We&nbsp;all deserve that, but it took me a long time to grow up and face my own internal emotional and mental issues and trauma, to be ready to receive and also reciprocate love in a healthy way,” she told PopBuzz. “I’ve always loved the thrill of love but my “ah-ha” moment was realizing if you actually want something real and long-lasting, [you have to] stop chasing that unpredictable roller coaster and start manifesting someone/somewhere you will feel safe. That’s the real dream—and I finally found it.”</p><p>In August 2020, Lauren released a debut album Midwest Kids Can Make It Big Deluxe with seven tracks.

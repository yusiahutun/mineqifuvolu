And we're not going to lie, so do we. Kate keeps it classic in her choice of sneakers, often opting for plimsolls or more functional trainers. That doesn't mean her choices are boring though – the Princess of Wales is quite bold in her colour choices, flitting from bright red to pale blue or even block colour with colourful accents.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHRQ4XNkfuQ data-wc=43>A royal wearing trainers might seem a little declasse, but nowadays, it's not that unusual.

"A box-fresh pair of trainers can gracefully tone down traditionally formal pieces like blazers and suits and this simple styling trick knows no bounds or social hierarchy, as even royals have embraced this trend, solidifying its position as a fashion staple.</p><p id=eMLGuY0Wao data-wc=75>"In the ever-evolving world of fashion, pairing trainers with tailored outfits has now become a the norm and the fusion of comfort and style is a match made in wardrobe heaven. Long gone are the days when dresses and trainers were considered an unconventional pairing - remember Lily Allen launching onto the scene in her then surprising trademark outfits of prom dresses and trainers in the noughties? The dress/trainer look has now become a go-to.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5ItwAkd_u4 data-wc=20>"Just be sure to make like Kate and keep your kicks cleaner than clean for a polished look from top-to-toe!"</p><h2><strong>Take a look through Kate's impressive trainer wardrobe and shop her go-to pairs</strong></h2><h2><strong>Kate wearing Lululemon</strong></h2><p id=e2SApuOlto data-wc=31>Kate's not been spotted out recently in trainers, but she changed all that when she made a visit to the Allam Sports Centre in Hull for a spot of wheelchair rugby.</p><p id=eICBeBItdg data-wc=44>Princess Kate was all smiles as she gave the game her best, and appears to be wearing a pair of Lululemon Chargefeel 2 Low Women's Workout shoes.

From arriving at her 'Back to Nature' garden at the Chelsea Flower Show last year wearing the plimsolls to the King's Cup Regatta in August 2020. Sweetly, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana also loved the same style</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Kate wearing Superga (again)</strong></h3><p id=e4s0yjyh_wlF data-wc=33>Last year, the royal shared a previously-unseen photograph from her time working on her own garden for the Chelsea Flower Show, and as usual fans loved seeing a glimpse at another never-before-seen outfit.</p><p id=eFSMjifevMEZ data-wc=53>This time around, it was an off-duty look for Kate - and she looked effortless in a loose khaki shirt (thought to be past-season Zara), blue skinny jeans and a green pair of her favourite Superga trainers. Kate's casual pumps are made in a khaki green canvas and have a contrast rubber sole.</p><h3><strong>Kate's rugby trainers</strong></h3><p id=ef5FkTRO0QI data-wc=59>To celebrate her appointment of becoming Patron of English Rugby, Kate took to pitch at Twickenham stadium and showed her rugby prowess.

The style has now sold out, but the New Balance Draft V1 is a similar style.</p><h3><strong>Kate wearing Adidas Pureboost X trainers&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=ew3Wvk9C771S data-wc=46>The Princess of Wales swapped a pair of Rupert Sanderson courts for a pair of lightweight £90 trainers when showing off her rowing skills in Portsmouth with Sir Ben Ainslie back in 2016. The snazzy turquoise laces jazzed up her all-black-ensemble like a style icon would.&nbsp;</p><p id=eqcs4ZtfkGET data-wc=30>Kate's Pureboost design has now sold out, but Adidas' revamped versions, the Ultraboost, are a great alternative - just switch the laces out for a bright, bold blue like Kate.</p><h3><strong>Kate wearing Mint Velvet plimsolls</strong></h3><p id=eqYO0DJDcmDv data-wc=47>The first time Kate was seen wearing her grey suede <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenersponsored nofollow">Mint Velvet</a></span> 'Bibi' plimsolls was back in 2013; a year later, she packed them for the Royal Tour to Australia and New Zealand.

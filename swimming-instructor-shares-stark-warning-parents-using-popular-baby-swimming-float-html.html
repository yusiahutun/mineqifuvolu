class=mol-para-with-font>'My take on the Mambo baby float,' she captioned the video before detailing the three reasons you should avoid purchasing the $79 floatation device.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nikki began by alleging that the swimming floatie wasn't a good choice because it isn't approved by the US Coast Guard.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next, she said she wouldn't recommend the Mambo baby float because it's 'notorious for flipping over.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'All it takes is for a child to lean forward a little too much and they're going to flip over.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And if they do flip over, they're strapped into this device so it's going to be more difficult for you to remove your child and get them poolside so evaluate them,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nikki explained that babies under four are 'very top-heavy,' meaning their 'heads are much bigger than their bodies.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Different postures in the water are going to be detrimental when it comes down to a child's survival, which is why we don't focus on doggy paddle positions below the age of four because they're at a higher risk of getting stuck in the vertical position,' she explained.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The swimming coach continued: 'If you take a look at a photo of a baby in the Mambo baby float, the little one is laying on her back but her head is propped up because she's looking at people.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If she were to fall in the water without that flotation, her body is going to be forced vertically because again her head is much bigger than her body.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-51f0add0b8ccfd3a

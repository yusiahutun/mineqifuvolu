All you have to do is put them on and remove them. To find your perfect fit, shop our airy and seamless nipple cover picks, from Nippies’s reusable pasties to Nood’s ultra-supportive breast tape below.

Not only are they excellent at providing coverage by naturally conforming to the breast, but they’re also smooth and remain invisible because of their ultra-thin silicone with a velvet finish that’s — bonus! — sweatproof and waterproof. Because of their light-reflective shield (meaning they can block light), they’re virtually undetectable, so you’re free to wear bright whites and take your Instagram pics with the flash on and never need to worry about exposure. Plus, they come in natural skin tones and adhesive and non-adhesive options. If you want maximum coverage while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>going braless</a>, though, the adhesives are the way to go because of their long-lasting staying power — though, they are a bit tricky to take off and you definitely need to follow the proper instructions.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Veteran bra designer and Chief Creator Officer of ThirdLove, Ra’el Cohen, raves about the longevity, saying that Nippies is the “only nipple cover brand” that has passed ThirdLove’s stringent testing and is the only nipple cover that ThirdLove sells on the site for that reason. “I’ve tried every nipple cover out there,” Cohen tells InStyle. “Believe me when I say not all of them are created equal.” And created equal, they are not; That’s why Nippies have earned our top spot, thanks to their inclusive shade range, impressive longevity, and effortless design. You could say picking Nippies as our best overall was as seamless as the silicone cups themselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-boomba-satin-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BOOMBA Satin Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BOOMBA Satin Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eXNbf6yhZj5y3k49MqYMtTUSzgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BOOMBA-Satin-Nipple-Covers-efe9d35de9c645b7860b8fa7e6c1fca3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BOOMBA</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The packaging is great for travel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The fabric is a bit thick under sheerer clothing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don't be fooled by the pretty appearance — these dainty-designed daisies aren’t just playful but also effective at creating a bra-free look. They are single-use, circular adhesive stick-ons that can be used for up to 12 hours. And during those 12 hours, they stay put and don’t wrinkle. There’s an easy-peel back backing for a seamless application, and the removal process is just as painless — you just peel back, and the gentle nipple cover glides off without leaving any residue. They’re also well-adjusted to larger breasts, with reviewers saying they provide coverage for DD+ bra sizes. Oh, and one last thing we adore about these: They come in super adorable, circular packaging that’s great for travel, which includes ten pairs of 3-inch diameter stick-on. Because of the thicker material, they might peek through sheerer clothing, but overall, they're worth the inexpensive price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Satin |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-gatherall-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gatherall Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gatherall Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7KtnWuJL9lDF9pcXhaLjo90qS_w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gatherall-Nipple-Covers-2e5f4331925c45e496d0b8a6ff2c1f40.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are ultra-lightweight but also super supportive.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You can’t return or exchange once opened because they’re intimate items.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These silicone stick-ons from Gatherall — a label known for their size and shade range inclusivity and, of course, their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">strapless, backless, and wireless bras</a> — prove that not only does Gatherall know how to create great adhesive bras, but they also produce fantastic bra alternatives. Keep your nipples concealed with these opaque covers that feel like a second layer of skin. Their stickiness is unbeatable, and their comfort is unmatched; They’re ultra-thin and breathable, which their tapered edge technology is probably to thank for, forcing them to stay flush with your skin. The first time I came across these 8cm diameter pasties was on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>their Instagram,</a> where they posted a video to prove their waterproof and sweatproof properties by running water over them, and when they didn’t budge, let me tell you, I was impressed. There was no evidence of perspiration around/outside the cup. But being impressed doesn’t stop there with this brand: They also provide excellent support for larger breasts and have an inclusive shade range.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Type</strong>: Unlined Cup | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-reusable-hollywood-fashion-secrets-silicone-coverups></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Reusable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hollywood Fashion Secrets Silicone Coverups</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hollywood Fashion Secrets Silicone Coverups" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8l8LDl5SzSIK2OnRAlXESHTAtZU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hollywood-Fashion-Secrets-Silicone-Coverups-c0c1b8a5e7454f938052f1482de8a4e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These attach firmly with every use.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If you are between large and small sizes, it may be harder to find an ideal fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Calling all <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>festival-goers</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wedding weekenders</a>, vacationers, or those who want to go <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>no-bra </a>for more than just one day — reusable silicone coverups will become your new go-to for backless, strapless, and halter-neck outfits. Their reusability makes them ideal for events and occasions, meaning they’re practical and effective. And not only are these nipple covers entirely convenient because of their reusability (which, hello, we also are a fan of because they’re more eco-friendly than disposables), but they have a firm adhesive strength, ensuring they stay secure and in place during activities.

They’re made from silicone that is approximately 2.5 inches wide. Compared to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>brand’s larger option</a> (4 inches wide), these are specifically made with smaller-chested folks in mind. Each box comes with two pasties that are reusable and washable, and the adhesive stays sticky, and they tend to stay like-new compared to others. Plenty of reviews call these petal covers “freeing,” noting that they cover the ideal amount while remaining moveable and seamless. We appreciate how they blend with your skin’s texture, creating a natural and comfortable fit. Overall, they’re a reliable solution for those looking to strike a balance between flexibility and coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular Adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-breasts-nood-no-show-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Large Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NOOD No-Show Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NOOD No-Show Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5b2Oa18GxznJA6nK2KwPEh55zaA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NOOD-No-Show-Nipple-Covers-b4a1dffeddbe4a85bcdd56d54b348a31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REVOLVE</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are sweatproof and waterproof.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The edges sometimes lift after multiple wears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NOOD is one of our favorite inclusive and sustainable solutionwear brands in the game.

Think of these as the cousin to the original matter silicone pasties. They have that same super-smooth feeling that provides seamless coverage on the breast while contouring the chest and providing more of a lift. They’re designed to give a 1-inch lift to create your ideal amount of cleavage. And despite having added lifting properties, these are still lightweight and ultra-thin. To accurately describe them, it’s easiest to put it like this: These are more than just nipple covers but still less than a bra, which is why we appreciate them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Type</strong>: Lifting Circular Adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-white-shirts-cakes-og-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For White Shirts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CAKES OG Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CAKES OG Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EW2MTjUsYDWVBVYToevLvfrGJic=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CAKES-OG-Nipple-Covers-46977c1fcd8d4ca09450569da71132df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>CAKES</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These have a super tapered edge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They are non-adhesive, so snug tops are recommended.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most seamless on the list, CAKES provides itself in being “grippy, not sticky” because they are non-adhesive. You might be thinking, how does that work? And we’ll tell you: They adhere naturally to your body heat under any snug-fitting top. Because of this, these are a fantastic option for those looking to wear sheer or white blouses and halters. Their fit is supreme because of their unique way of staying on the body and because they have individual, cup-size offerings. CAKES comes in three different versions, including their Itty Bitty (AA-A cups), CAKES OG (B-DD cups), and CAKES (+), for sizes DDD+. Also, if you need extra coverage, CAKES can be used underneath swimsuits because they’re waterproof, making them a no-frills favorite. So, if you have that see-through white bikini that you need a quick fix for, these non-adhesive nipple covers are a solid option for a more solid-colored look.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular Non-Adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wedding-dresses-nubra-seamless-adhesive-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wedding Dresses</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NuBra Seamless Adhesive Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NuBra Seamless Adhesive Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qPOe9DmMxS8M638A3m3-vJbgBv0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NuBra-Seamless-Adhesive-Bra-535cae03d2e349199fd29e062827029c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This bra is super lightweight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Not the most supportive for larger breasts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For all brides-to-be, there are plenty of things to consider before the big day, so understandably, underwear can go under the radar. However, an ill-fitting bra or bra that slips or itches can seriously take you out of a moment, which is why selecting the proper solution-wear for a wedding is so important. This seamless adhesive bra from NuBra is an absolute dream. Available in sizes A-E, it’s a seamless adhesive bra with separate foam cups. The body is entirely backless, making it an ideal option for those with wedding gowns with intricate detailing, like low and open backs. There are no binding straps, so it’s entirely strapless, though it still adds support — surprising, we know! Backless bras can be complicated; strapless bras can be even more hassle. But with this combo of the two, none of the frills associated with tricky bras come with this seamless adhesive from NuBra.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Type</strong>: Backless Bra | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-perkies-petals-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Perkies Petals Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Perkies Petals Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SBp6KT1X41QfWG617p13gm2ozh8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Perkies-Petals-Nipple-Covers-f8ebf9657c944e9cbefd5404a8efc123.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These provide coverage under sheer fabrics and white tees.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They are a bit small for larger breasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Reusable, washable, hypoallergenic: These Perkies Petals are those things and so much more. If you’re in a rush and need to Amazon Prime some nipple covers (been there — a complicated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>asymmetrical going-out top</a> was to blame), these deliver results and deliver fast. They have fantastic coverage, staying invisible underneath sheer fabrics and white tees, and have a barely-there feeling. No pesky outline of a nipple cover can be seen here! Instead, they’re pasties that form well to the natural breast (though we wish they were a bit larger for bigger chests) and have a long-lasting staying power. We appreciate how long the stick lasts, especially since these are wardrobe staples.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular Adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tape-nood-shape-tape></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tape</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NOOD Shape Tape</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NOOD Shape Tape" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oEO5fHEVp-0jHW3R2B01sYwuDYs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NOOD-Shape-Tape-9926bb0731cb4a99b6050cb4317eb78c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This breast tape is made with a sustainable hemp adhesive.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s pricer than other tape options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for backless bra options that will give you flawless coverage and come in various shades to match all different skin tones, Shaw Lewis, a bra fitting expert and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>luxury lingerie shop owner</a>, recommends checking out Nood’s Shape Tape because it gives a great lift and is waterproof. “It’s a top-selling style in-store and online.

It’s a multi-purpose breast tape that remains invisible under outfits because of its adhesive security and impeccable shade range. It also provides impressive lift, shape, and support, even for those with larger breasts. Each role is 3” x 13.1’ and is made with a more sustainable and skin-friendly adhesive made from a hemp blend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Hemp, nylon |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Type</strong>: Breast Tape | <strong>Reusable? </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shade-range-muqu-pasties-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shade Range</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MUQU Pasties Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MUQU Pasties Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xCxtJgJO_eArdDNpOJLJKSmS7lI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MUQU-Pasties-Nipple-Covers-8b922f182f2347c7b3b28bea01c59e5a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These include both circular and petal options in the bundle.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The adhesive is not as strong of a hold as other options on this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are so many options to choose from with these MUQU pasties, which is why we recommend them. If you’re into a petal-shaped pastie, they include them in their portable pack; If you’re looking for something more simple, they include classic circular adhesives. And not only do they provide the best of both worlds with these two shapes, but they also have an impressive shade range. The brand offers six skin-tone-specific solutions that blend seamlessly into the skin. If you’ve always had trouble matching your skin tone to your nipple cover, these are a trustworthy alternative to brands that (unfortunately) only carry a limited range of styles and tones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone |<strong> Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Type</strong>: Circular Adhesive | <strong>Reusable? </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Reusable or Not</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nipple covers come in both disposable and reusable options. Deciding which to buy all comes down to personal preference and lifestyle, though there are some pluses to both alternatives. Since reusable nipple covers are worn more than once, they are more environmentally friendly, more cost-effective, and often made with more skin-friendly materials to provide comfort and flexibility with each wear. Disposable pasties are more convenient since they are designed for single use, are more travel friendly, and eliminate the need for washing since you’ll be sporting a fresh cover every time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nipple pasties are made of soft, skin-friendly materials like silicone, fabric, or adhesive paper. Silicone — possibly the most popular option — is soft, flexible, and durable, while other covers, particularly disposable, are made from smooth fabrics like satin, nylon, and cotton. Choosing a material comes down to personal preference, but it’s essential to follow the tag’s instructions for proper application, care, and usage.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you can think of a shape, chances are, there’s a nipple cover made in its image.

They include a sticky, medical-grade adhesive on one side to ensure the cover stays in place and naturally conforms to the breast.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you take nipple covers off?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each nipple cover application should <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">include skin prep and removal</a>, like your face makeup routine. For removal, gently and slowly peel off the nipple covers from the outside edge toward the center. In some cases where the adhesive is too stubborn to remove, an oil-based product like coconut oil, baby oil, or bra tape-specific removers will loosen the stick. A damp cloth or warm water may help, too. Avoid pulling on the skin directly, especially if the adhesive is still sticking, as this can cause discomfort and irritation to tender parts of the chest.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What size should nipple covers be?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nipple covers come in an extensive range of sizes and shapes to accommodate plenty of breast sizes. To determine the appropriate size, you can measure the diameter of the nipple (the distance across the circular part), as most are labeled with diameter size (i.g., 3 inches, 3.5 inches). This is all, of course, dependent on coverage preference and style choice — if you want something with a little less coverage, we say go for it! Just remember to size down.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Philadelphia-based freelance writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Morgan Sullivan</a> has written for multiple publications, including Cosmopolitan, The Cut, and Glamour, focusing mainly on beauty, fashion, and health.

I think my splotchy red and brown hair color bears a striking similarity to that of Alfred E. Newman of Mad magazine fame. That was the first thing that popped into my head but fortunately not out of my mouth.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“Wow!” I said to her beaming reflection in the mirror. “Fantastic, as always.”</p><p>Anyone looking at the top half of my face — bulging eyes and eyebrows raised to the heavens — might have guessed I was auditioning for a remake of Janet Leigh’s famous shower scene in the movie Psycho. But my Naturally Beautiful Stylist (we’ll call her NBS for short) — who had cut and shaped and dyed my hair for a decade — homed in on my toothy smile as she stepped back to admire her work, adding a touch of hairspray as she remarked my new hair color was perfect for the season.</p><p>“Love it,” I said.</p><p>Yes, I lied. I lied as I sat in the chair. I lied when I gave her a generous tip. I lied as I paid the bill at the front desk.</p><p>Once I made my way to the parking lot and my red Mini Cooper, I couldn’t lie anymore. One glance in the Union Jack-adorned rearview mirror confirmed my hair looked hideous — no lie. It was not even close to the edgy dark hair under blonde hair I had requested.</p><p>No, I didn’t cry. That’s not my style either (ha!). I just knew I had to break up with my stylist. I knew the price I might pay in doing so.</p><p>Through the years I have come to realize there are two types of people in the world: those with naturally gorgeous hair and those with naturally ghastly hair. Those with the gorgeous hair spent the past decades with tresses that mirrored the ironing board-straight with tiny end flip styles of Olivia Newton John and Diana Ross, the blonde and bouncy style of Farrah Fawcett, the pin-straight look of Ali McGraw and the soft spiral of Donna Summers. You’ve seen them move through the current decades as Halle Berry/Eva Longoria/Sofia Vergara/Gwyneth Paltrow hair look-a-likes.</p><p>Those that have ghastly hair, like me, spent the decades resembling a whole different group of celebrities. Mine included Dennis the Menace complete with cowlick thanks to what I hoped would be an edgy cropped cut. And then I spent years with the lank, greasy look —complete with ear poking through — of Kathy Bates’ character in the movie Misery. And none of that rivals that time in my 20s when I happily paid half a week’s salary at a top salon for a perm I thought would add body to the filament I call hair. After an hour at work — 30 minutes of which were spent in the staff ladies room, I returned to my desk with red-rimmed eyes following a futile battle to tame what a taunting co-worker had jokingly deemed “the tumbleweed that landed on your head.”</p><p>At least my watery eyes ensured no one else commented on my hair that day.</p><p>Through the years I learned that you can’t trust a name salon or even the recommendations of your friends. You have to find a stylist both strangers and friends recommend, ensure the stylist has the personal panache you seek and get ready to pay.</p><p>That’s how I chose NBS. The first time I saw the lean, long legged NBS stride across the salon I gawked. I couldn’t assume her thin body or perfect bone structure but heaven help me I wanted her hair.</p><p>Through the years we became chums — not really friends, but beyond acquaintances. She told me about her husband’s sudden death and raising her son. I told her about my hobbies, my husband and my work.</p><p>And all the while, she styled my hair with the same care she used on her own.</p><p>Until about three years ago. That’s when I noticed that no matter what photos I brought in, no matter how much I talked about the look I wanted, my hair became an increasingly bad version of ‘80s volume and color.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter how much you like her,” said my best friend Lisa when I called her from the car. “You deserve the hair you want.”</p><p>She’s right. So why do I feel guilty that the new stylist I selected — based on Yelp and personal reviews — talked to me for just five minutes and colored and styled my hair just as I wanted? Why do I feel like a traitor when I agree with the new stylist that NBS gave me a ridiculous amount of bangs? What am I going to say if I see NBS at the farmers market, at the store, at the gasoline station?</p><p>I predict I’ll greet her warmly and ask about her new husband and her son and her family and tell her I miss her. I do. But I won’t lie about my hair or return to her shop.</p><p>Sometimes relationships — business and personal — need to end. This was one of those times.</p><p>And now I finally have what I wanted.</p><p>This essay was written by <a href=#>Nancy Dunham</a>, an award-winning freelance journalist based outside Washington, D.C.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More from FIRST</h2><p><a href=#>4 Reasons Why I Have Totally Given Up on Black Friday, and You Should Too</a></p><p><a href=#>How to Be a Good Middle-Aged Daughter to an Aging Parent</a></p><p><a href=#>My Menopause Treatment Caused Me to Grow a Tiny Penis</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomZ6ZpanGcK7RnpikoZ6cera8jLCgraBdosZuv9Oyo6KrpGJ%2BdYSSbmo%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./luna-mills-actress-wiki-career-biography-boyfriend-age-height-weight-and-more.html>&#171;&nbsp;Luna Mills (Actress) Wiki, Career, Biography, Boyfriend, Age, Height, Weight and More</a>

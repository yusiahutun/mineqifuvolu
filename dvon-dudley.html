I’m upset.’</p><p>Some news sites did print those remarks, indicating D-Von to laugh at them for reporting the direct quotes.

LOL, I need to make up things more often.’ ‘Lmao, let them keep writing.’</p><p>I’ll look at it this way they must be watching a show every week to see what I’m gonna say I think that’s hilarious (sic)’ When a follower replied asking him to clarify whether he was actually gay or not, he responded: ‘No I’m not.</p><p>Not surprisingly, notwithstanding some laughing along, many fans were left shocked and a bit hindered by the situation, with many of them calling him out over the remarks.</p><h2>D’von Dudley | Net worth, Salary & Quotes</h2><p>In the Wrestling entertainment business context, the wrestler’s salary and payment differ accordingly and depend on experience, league, and success.</p><p>Following WWE, a median professional wrestler earns around $500,000 a year.

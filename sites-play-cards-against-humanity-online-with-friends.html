the internet has provided tons of opportunities for people to stay connected even during this challenging time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, various websites allow you to play board and card games with your friend even if you’re still socially distancing and quarantining. One card game that now exists in the digital realm is Cards Against Humanity.</p><p>If you love playing this game, we have listed below the top 3 websites you can use to play Cards Against Humanity online for free.</p><h2 id=reminders-before-playing-card-against-humanity-online>Reminders Before Playing Card Against Humanity Online</h2><p>Do you know that half of the fun and thrill that you get from playing Cards Against Humanity comes from seeing how your friends react to your picks? That’s why it is crucial to set up a video call using <a href=#>video conferencing apps such as Zoom</a>. This ensures that everyone taking part in the game can see each participant’s reaction.</p><p>You also need to ensure that everyone’s mics and cameras are working properly. Finally, ask all the participants if they are familiar with the rules of the game. If they aren't, give them a refresher before you begin the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Facebook Instant Games to Play With Friends</a></span></p><p>Here’s a quick summary of how to play the game:</p><ul><li>Cards Against Humanity has two types of cards: black and white. Each round, a player will ask a question by picking a black card. Then, everyone else will choose one of the white cards from their hand to submit the funniest and most inappropriate answer. The player who picked the black card (or the game master) will choose which white card is the most amusing answer. At the end of the game, the person who gets the most black card or submits the most cards with the funniest answer wins the game.</li></ul><p>Once everyone is familiar with the rules and ready to play, visit any sites below to play Cards Against Humanity clones online.</p><h2 id=all-bad-cards>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Bad Cards</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/all-bad-cards.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While All Bad Cards isn’t the official Cards Against Humanity online website, it is still one clone that can impress beginners and experienced players. This site works just like the original game and includes many equally disturbing cards.</p><p>Apart from creating a room with your friends, you can join other rooms if you enjoy playing with strangers or even create a public room. You can also play with AI competitors yourself if you just need to blow off some steam and laugh. Each game you start can hold up to fifty players. Imagine the fun you can have with a large group.</p><p>In addition, you can buy premium cards to level up the fun. Super Backers get ten exclusive decks for only $7, equal to over 2,3000 additional cards. Apart from getting extra cards, purchasing the premium deck also supports the game developers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, if you don’t want to spend cash, the free deck comes with everything you’ll need to enjoy the game, with some created by other users. You can also build your own deck if you want to make the game more personalized.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Quick Web Games to Play Online When You're Bored</a></span></p><h2 id=pretend-you-rsquo-re-xyzzy>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretend You’re Xyzzy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pretend-your-xyzzy.jpg><p>If you like the depth of the Cards Against Humanity game, this clone is the best option for you.</p><p>For those who have been playing the game, you probably know that the original game comes with different expansion decks that add up to hundreds of cards with hilarious combinations. Pretend You’re Xyzzy claims that it has all of these expansion decks, which increases the fun of playing Cards Against Humanity online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that we don’t like about this clone is that you need to have at least three players to start the game. This means that you can’t use it with bots or by yourself. But if you’ve already <a href=#>organized an online game night</a>, this wouldn’t be much of a problem.</p><p>With this clone game, you can customize your game and add as many cards as you like. You can also create your own rules, the number of players in a game, and be a spectator if you don’t feel like joining the game.</p><p>This clone game is the closest you can find to the original Cards Against Humanity deck. So if you want to play something that closely resembles the actual cards, this should be your go-to site.</p><p>You can check out the decks available, along with the cards that come with it, before you start the game. This clone also comes with a chat box, so if you don’t feel like doing a video chat, the internal chat room should be enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sites to Play Board Games Online with Video Chat and Across Computers or Phones</a></span></p><h2 id=cards-against-formality>3. <a href=#>Cards Against Formality</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cards-against-formality.jpg><p>If you are new to this game or just playing with someone not too familiar with technology, this website is for you. The website is simple, and because of its simplicity, you can even invite your grandparents to play.</p><p>With the user interface, it is minimalist, but it has a slight resemblance to the real Cards Against Humanity game. This makes it easy for experienced players to get familiar with the game quickly.</p><p>Like All Bad Cards, you can also play with strangers. You can just join any room and play the game. But if you like to create your own game and invite your friends, you can make the game private by adding a password to your room, so strangers don’t intrude on your fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Cards Against Formality, you can name your game, set the maximum target number of players (up to 50), and the time of how long each round will last. You can also choose your own deck, and this game has 25 different decks to choose from.</p><h2 id=play-however-you-want>Play However You Want</h2><p>Since these games above are customizable, you can play Cards Against Humanity however you like.

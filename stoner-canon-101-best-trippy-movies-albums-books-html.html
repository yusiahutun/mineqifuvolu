Solnit revels in the vast gray areas of contradiction (“To calculate on the unforeseen,” she writes, “is perhaps exactly the paradoxical operation that life most requires of us.”) and invites us to question whether getting “lost,” in every sense of the word, must always be such a bad thing.

The sonic effects — all the stereo panning, the way the drums shimmer, that omnipresent wah-wah guitar — are placed with wizardly detail. The lyrics — even on the epic aquatic love story <a href=#>“1983 … (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)”</a> — have an earthiness, a solidity, to them, free from any of that Professor Picadilly’s tangerine-tart whimsy that sank so many of the era’s songwriters. And Jimi’s vocals have a mystical, lagging quality, as if the words were coming to him in the half-instant before he sang them. All this adds up. Electric Ladyland isn’t the work of someone dillydallying with psychedelic signifiers, drooling while he futzes around with the crossfaders. It’s is an album made by a genius who spent years high, heard special music in his head, and then painstakingly translated it, or as much of it as he could, onto this eternal album.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/521/6a3/a4e58509adaa12d9e75faaad35c76d880d-enter-the-void-1.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjg87vs6k00ns3b600ysd4zyh@published>Enter the Void (2009)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjg87vs6k00nt3b60twxzgjg7@published data-word-count=147>In director Gaspar Noe’s sensory overdrive <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>film</a>, a soul departs a murdered DMT fiend and wanders freely, but in a kind of purgatory, in an overwhelming Tokyo we experience through his eyes (er, disembodied psyche).

Along the way of this day in the life of newly unemployed Ice Cube — fired on his day off! — viewers meet a menagerie of oddball characters and learn valuable stoner lessons&nbsp;from Chris Tucker’s Smokey: “Puff, puff, give” is proper rotation etiquette, mixing weed with angel dust is bad news, and never get high on your own supply, especially when you owe Big Perm, er, Big Worm. If only getting high gave everyone the strength to knock out the community bully. One can dream.

On opener <a href=#>“Master of My Craft,”</a> they remember that even “Socrates died in a fucking gutter,” and on <a href=#>“No Ideas,”</a> a shrink tells them they know zilch — so, they figure, why not light up some Acapulco Gold and ramble on? Elsewhere, singer Andrew Savage teaches us rad ways of dealing with being a young aimless-jobless in the land of the oppressed — like declaiming just about everything one can about the experience of eating a tasty doughnut while avoiding a gnarly tumble into its ever-widening hole. Every tight riff leads to the next long before wearing out its welcome, and your confused inner voice will find good company here.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/710/ba3/1b8c739ad641dbf93f4e892d0b64beefee-lo-borges.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjg88i4db011l3b60ek2th590@published>Lo Borges, Lo Borges (1972)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjg88i4db011m3b6030koqyg5@published data-word-count=88>Along with the better-known Milton Nascimento, among others, Lo Borges came out of the thriving, exploratory early ‘60s–’70s Clube da Esquina music scene of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.

But what ensues is a story of great empathy for a middle-class Texan clan in post–World War II America, one pieced together the way real memories feel and operate: like patchworks of whispers, screams, soft light, and dark retreat that meet somewhere in time with our present selves. And, as Tree of Life’s ending might suggest, en route to reconciliation. It’s essential late-night transcendence that’ll certainly pair well with your glaucoma medicine.

And network TV, at that! Years before cable series began pushing the limits and before Adult Swim proved people weren’t afraid of the absurd or the surreal, David Lynch was shining a light on small-town America and showing how bizarre it could actually be. Plenty of other artists had implicated everyday citizens in tales of murder and deceit, but few had bothered to acknowledge all the freaks and weirdos that live there, too. No drug is going to make it make any more sense (could anything?), but it might make you more comfortable with the surrealism.

But Kubrick’s film was also, as it so happens, a watershed for stoner movies: An entire generation of flower children turned going to see 2001 into a national pastime. And who can blame them? The film’s elegant longueurs, its oblique narrative, its literally trippy special effects (particularly the infamous “Stargate” sequence, a dizzying, surreal roller-coaster ride through the cosmos) all made it a perfect movie to which one could tune out.

Throughout the six long tracks of Vocalcity, it’s riveting. Though the shifts feel minimal and gradual, your ears will continually pick up on new shards — which you’ll love to swim in the swirl of — and your body won’t stop moving.

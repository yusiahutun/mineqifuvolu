The reason she was punished appears to stem from the fact that she got blunt with her superior about needing to bring her bag to the bathroom so she could change her pad.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While she has accepted the repercussions, she explained that her sister did not approve of what she did and chided her.

The famous frontman died only a couple of months after burying one of his closest friends, after decades of fighting addiction and heartbreaking struggles.</strong></p><p>Chester Bennington was devastated by his friend’s death in 2017, Chris Cornell. After the passing had a resonating effect on the <a href=#>music</a> icon, he penned a letter where he hoped Chris would find peace “in the next life”. Tragically, Chester was found dead on Cornell’s birthday, but nothing about his behavior beforehand alarmed his family, his wife later revealed. He was just 41. We look back on the incredible Chester Bennington before his death, and how fans still mourn him years later.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chester-bennington-s-final-days-before-his-death>Chester Bennington’s final days before his death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-824901466-1024x683.jpg><p>At the time, there wasn’t anything that would be a sign that Chester may hurt himself, his wife later said. However, on the first anniversary of Chester Bennington’s death, she looked back and felt there could have been warnings in hindsight.</p><p>Talinda, Chester’s widow, told <a href=# rel=nofollow>CNN</a> she’s more educated on the signals now, but can spot them following his passing.</p><p>“The hopelessness, the change of behavior, isolation,” could have been a warning, she said.</p><p>However, she explained they were common trends of the <a href=#>celebrity</a> who battled depression for a number of years.</p><p>She added: “That was all part of our daily life. Sometimes some signs were there more than others. Sometimes, they weren’t there at all.”</p><p>In Chester Bennington’s final days before his death, he was on vacation with his family. During the trip, he decided to head back home for a <a href=#>TV</a> commercial. Further, Talinda said he was “at his best” the night before he took his own life.</p><p>Talinda explained: “This was not a time where we or any of our family suspected this to happen, which is terrifying… We thought everything was OK.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nobody-knew-the-depths>‘Nobody knew the depths’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Bandmate Mike Shinoda spoke out about his friend’s death on The Howard Stern Show. The co-founder admitted it sparked a dark time and various emotions.</p><p>Months before that fateful night, the frontman opened up about his depression on the Waking Up Dad podcast. Although, his close friends and loved ones were not aware of how severe it was, Shinoda said.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the beginning when I met Chester,” he told Stern.</p><p>“I didn’t know his stories. As I got to know him, I would find myself oftentimes saying, ‘I’ve never heard such a crazy upbringing, such a crazy childhood.’ Like, running wild in the streets and doing hard drugs on the roof of his high school, just like barely staying out of jail. That’s what made our dynamic what it was.</p><p>“I didn’t live like that. I felt like I was an outsider because I was a mixed-race kid that didn’t have a community to belong to. I’m half Japanese. I don’t speak Japanese. I don’t look Japanese. The white kids thought I was, obviously, not white. The Latino kids were, like, starting to speak to me in Spanish; I didn’t speak any Spanish. I was always floating around and I didn’t have a home …</p><p>“He was outside because he was scrawny, he was like picked on, he was bullied all the time.”</p><p>Chester opened up about the struggles he faced with his <a href=#>health</a>, addiction and being abused when he was 18. Fans implored the star for being able to speak about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heartbreaking-letter-he-wrote-to-his-friend>Heartbreaking letter he wrote to his friend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-688801616-1024x683.jpg><p>After the death of Chester Bennington’s friend Cornell, he wrote a moving letter. He shared the note on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>The singer, who is still ‘missed beyond words’ by fans, wrote: “I’m still weeping, with sadness, as well as gratitude for having shared some very special moments with you and your beautiful family.</p><p>“You have inspired me in many ways you could never have known. Your talent was pure and unrivaled.”</p><p>He added: “I can’t imagine a world without you in it. I pray you find peace in the next life.”</p><p>The two friends met in the mid-2000s, and Cornell would support Link Park during their Projekt Revolution tour in 2008. Chester even asked him to be his son’s godfather in 2005.</p><p>On the day of Cornell’s death, Linkin Park had a scheduled performance on Jimmy Kimmel. They decided to play One More Light as tribute to their dear friend. But it had an impact on the 41-year-old. Shinoda later explained he “couldn’t make it through the song” during the soundcheck.</p><p>“And even when we did play the whole song, and it was live on TV, or taped for film for TV, he kind of just stopped like towards the end like he missed the last couple of lines, just couldn’t finish the song,” Shinoda added.</p><p>He would then go on to sing Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah at Cornell’s memorial service.</p><p><strong>Watch the emotional performance below.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fighting-alcohol-addiction>Fighting alcohol addiction</h2><p>Weeks before he died, Chester confided in his friend Ryan Shuck that he had only been sober for six months. He feared that he was falling off the wagon and the old habits were coming back.</p><p>The autopsy <a href=# rel=nofollow>report</a> detailed by the Los Angeles County coroner’s Officer states he only had a minute amount of alcohol in his blood. Although one blood test noted Chester tested “presumptive positive” for MDMA (or ecstasy), two additional tests failed. The report concluded he was not under the influence of the drug when he passed away. He was taking part in an outpatient treatment program at the time.</p><p>Tragically, Chester Bennington’s death, on July 20, 2017, was ruled as suicide. He was found on what would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday.</p><p>Chester left behind his wife Talinda and six children, Tyler and twin daughters Lily and Lila. He also shared Jamie, Isaiah and Draven from previous relationships.</p><p>The band paid tribute in October of that year with a concert at the Hollywood Bowl.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.

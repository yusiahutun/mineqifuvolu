The brand is so loved, that even celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Lopez</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hailey Bieber</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Taylor Swift</a> have been seen gracing the streets in one (or three) of their pieces. Scrolling through their catalog of floral dresses, silky gowns, and summery linen staples, it’s really no surprise why the label amassed such fame. Their designs are sleek, artfully crafted, and intentionally cut to compliment the feminine figure. When you shop at Reformation, quality and flattery are both guaranteed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More than just looking cute, however, the ethical brand moves with sustainability as its northern star. They go beyond just sourcing recycled, regenerative, or renewable materials, but consider everything from water, land, and energy usage to gas emissions. They even have their very own recycling program called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">RefRecycling</a>, where you can give certain pieces a second chance at fashion.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so many people pledging their loyalty to Reformation, I wanted to jump on the bandwagon as well and see which of their pieces reigned as the best of the best. The team at Reformation kindly sent me a range of their pieces, and I’ve collected my honest review below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-universal-reformation-lindy-knit-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Universal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Knit Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Lindy Knit Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WBnpADrhluD8iSh_hI9lUgOZcZI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Lindy-Knit-Top-3614ec4ffff140e9961f14e77b5c05de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>From sweatpants to skirts, this top looks good with absolutely everything.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s slightly cropped, making it only good for high-waisted bottoms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the most universal pick, I have to give it to this Lindy Knit top. I found myself reaching for it far too often, given how it elevated absolutely everything. I’d honestly go so far as to say it was the missing link to all my incomplete outfits — those that needed something more than a basic tank top, but less than an over-the-top going-out shirt. The high-neck, ruched sides, and form-fitting knit added a smart and tasteful touch to my look. The fabric feels soft and comfortable and looks equally as high-end. I paired it with jeans, leather pants, skirts, and sweatpants all the same, and it delivered that put-together feel across the board. It is a little cropped, however, so bottoms that aren’t high-waisted will show some belly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite it dipping low on the side, no bra I ever wore peeped through to say hi to the sunlight. The ivory color I wore was also perfectly opaque — not even my pink bra was visible through the fabric. And while it does come in a plethora of other colors, we recommend white, black, and gray for versatility.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 <strong>| Materials: </strong>Organic cotton, spandex<strong> | Sizes: </strong>XS–XL</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-dress-reformation-enya-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long Dress</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Enya Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Enya Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8NvZQLSoC3L0QsOuaRE8xdzfofQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Enya-Dress-eb2d43cad52741589c5ec163dde08219.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s the perfect wedding guest dress.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can wrinkle, so proper storage is recommended.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The original dress I tried, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Emersyn Dress</a>, is sadly no longer in production (though, you can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">buy it used on Poshmark</a>, if you’re really set on it), but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jasen dress</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Enya Dress</a> (the more universal option) are almost identical to it, sans the deep emerald green color, unless you purchase the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jasen in petite sizing</a>, which would be great for anyone under five-foot-three. Swap the midi hem for a maxi, add spaghetti straps for tie straps, and tack on a ruffle, and you’ve got this gorgeous alternative. I wore it as a wedding guest dress, and not only did it look good on me, but also the forest green color fit the Alpine backdrop of the venue immaculately. With the sweetheart neckline, the A-line skirt, and the ruched hem that you can find on the alternatives, the dress was truly flattering from top to bottom. It was a magnet for compliments and allowed me to feel like a princess without breaking any wedding attire etiquette. The slim-fitting bodice framed my chest and face nicely, and the flowy skirt made dancing a breeze. I did notice that it was a little wrinkled from the suitcase, however; hanging it up for 24 hours prior to the wedding was essential for a crease-free experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Materials: </strong>Viscose<strong> | Sizes: </strong>0-12</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-midi-dress-reformation-juliette-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Midi Dress</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Juliette Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Juliette Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xTFxC8TvhnnztrLuVrWwLEWp2H4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Juliette-Dress-88d469a6fa5d476599e1d30dd36b1131.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The silhouette is extremely flattering, making it a perfect vacation dress.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The slit is really high and might not be appropriate for certain occasions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, we had to include Reformation’s infamous Juliette dress — which you’ve probably seen on celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber</a>. First impression? The silhouette is like a girly girl’s dream. It comes in four patterns (mainly whimsical florals) and two bold, solid colors. Spaghetti straps hold a form-fitting bodice in place, while the A-line skirt cuts off just below the knees for a feminine fit all around. It even features a slit up the left leg for added sex appeal. Be aware, though, as this slit goes pretty high up the thigh — high enough to make me a little too self-conscious to wear it at a wedding. Especially when sitting down, I feel the need to wrap the skirt over my legs to hide the exposed skin. For a cute stroll into town, though, it is perfect. It’s soft, graceful, and fun — the perfect vacation dress, if you ask me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Materials: </strong>Viscose <strong>&nbsp;| Sizes: </strong>0–12</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-short-dress-reformation-aubree-linen-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Short Dress</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Aubree Linen Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Aubree Linen Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KwVAyafzlxsoFYIVnW8CZSWi5L8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Aubree-Linen-Dress-804367314d6b4debae7a772099faf350.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The linen feels substantial in the ha</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>For tall women, the dress might feel a little too short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Multiple friends told me that the linen used by Reformation is exceptional. Makes sense, considering they’re made from flax that basically uses no water, emitting a fourth of the carbon of cotton per pound. I tried this mini dress on at their store location in SoHo and immediately fell in love. The linen felt substantial in my hands, evidencing its high quality. The minimalist appeal, with a straight neckline and silhouette, makes it ideal for more casual outings. In the back, two bowties attach the spaghetti strap to the body of the dress and add just the right amount of whimsy to the dress. I only wished it was an inch longer. On my five-foot-eight body, it was ever-so-slightly too short.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>5 <strong>| Materials: </strong>Linen <strong>| Sizes: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shorts-reformation-mason-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Mason Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Mason Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YZ30WuTpo0o8sBhJzP1Kbm9WILg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Mason-Short-7a1acf9d1fd24d10b9a3bde198064d2c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a very faint suede texture on the exterior of the pants, that makes them feel luxurious.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The back pockets are stitched closed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These shorts check all the boxes for me. Sophisticated length? Check. Quality materials? Check. Soft and comfortable? Double check. What really impressed me, though, was the very subtle suede texture on them. Made of Tencel lyocell, which is inherently not suede, the dress feels so soft that it mimics the sensation of touching suede just a little. (We know, it sounds silly, but trust us on this one.) Most of all, I love how elegant the shorts look. It’s the kind of shorts you can wear out to rooftop bars with a nice top and some sunglasses. The piece is a great addition to my roster of shorts that are either too long, too short, too denim, or too casual for such nights out. If only the back pockets weren’t sewn together, these would be perfect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> | Materials: </strong>Tencel lyocell <strong>| Sizes: </strong>0–12</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jeans-reformation-liza-ultra-high-rise-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Liza Ultra High Rise Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Liza Ultra High Rise Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EUMPa00JuhlPWWj9WnSFOFcQtIM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-liza-ultra-high-rise-jeans-c0f67203448e412dbdffb203eb18f59e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re just the right amount of thickness, making them feel substantial.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run a little small, feeling tight around the waist.<strong></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The minute Reformation jeans received the stamp of approval from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Holmes</a>, I knew I had to try them as well. I would describe these pants as mostly rigid, but they do have some stretch to them. More importantly, though, they have just the right amount of thickness to them (my biggest pet peeve is thin denim). These ones are nice and strong, making me feel confident in their ability to keep me warm. The superior structure also feels like it would last for a decade, but if you ever outgrow them in any way, you can completely recycle them through Reformation’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">RefRecycling program</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I ordered my usual size, 26, and found them to be a little snug around the waist. It’s not the jeans I’d take to Italy where pasta-filled days are ensured, but it works fine for everyday errands. When our editorial team tested out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>several different Reformation jeans</a>, everyone had something different to say about their sizing (too large, too small, perfect fitting), so it looks like you’re going to have to play some denim roulette to get the right size. The brand does offer free shipping and returns, though, so you can do some trial and error cost-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> | Materials: </strong>Organic cotton, Tencel lyocell, eco lycra<strong> | Sizes: </strong>23–31</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-top-reformation-pollie-linen-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Top</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Pollie Linen Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Pollie Linen Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4j5eG0uzWPCeGap93VOgbWzNZ78=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Pollie-Linen-Top-48da0a7a8f4742a1a41927f4e3bdcaa9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The linen fabric, the open back, and the spaghetti straps not only make this a beautiful piece, but an ideal piece for the summer.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can look a little bulky from the front.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“J’adore!” was the first thing I blurted out when I put on this top. The 100 percent flax linen top is truly masterfully created. With a straight neckline, a three-tiered ruched front, and an open back, you won’t find this unique design just anywhere. While we love how beautiful the front is, it celebrates your back in a way I’ve never experienced by keeping it mainly open with spaghetti straps looping through the sides and tying endearingly at the lower back. I already know it’s going to be my go-to shirt during the peak of summer, whether I’m going to the city or the beach. I did notice the elastic band sometimes rode up my body, making the front look a little bulky and requiring me to pull it down several times a day. Nothing that bothered me, but worth calling out if you prefer a fuss-free top.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 <strong>| Materials: </strong>Linen <strong>| Sizes:</strong> XS-XL</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sneakers-reformation-harlow-leather-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sneakers</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Harlow Leather Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Harlow Leather Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h8lkNtnONYt6SLF_MphuLjwavAs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Harlow-Leather-Sneaker-9704e236d1ee4f70aebd5f76182618da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can recycle them 100 percent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re (very) difficult to slip into.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harlow leather sneakers</a> are more than just cute new kicks.

But even if, say, you didn’t care about sustainability (which you should), the shoes are so cute that it’s easy to adore them simply for their aesthetics.

But the block heel makes walking easy, and I would wear them for both casual and formal occasions. The only con is how they dig into the top of the foot. It’s enough to make you want to buy some bandages to cushion the friction.

Over the span of three weeks, she wore each individual piece both outdoors and indoors to see how they performed in real life. (She even packed some pieces on a vacation to Germany.) While wearing each piece, she paid close attention to comfort, stretch, quality, durability, opacity, and style.

They’re on a mission to normalize sustainability by sourcing 100 percent of their fabrics from recycled, regenerative, or renewable materials by 2025. But beyond just their materials, they create a healthy, safe, and fair working environment in their factory, located right in Los Angeles. They also consider their water impact, CO2 emissions, land use, and more, looking at sustainability with a 360-degree lens. In order to eliminate waste, many of their products are given a second chance at fashion through their recycling program called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">RefRecycle</a>. And so that we may always hold them accountable for their promises, they keep their sustainability report publicly available right <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The nice thing about shopping at Reformation is that quality fabrics are guaranteed. The mentioned products range from viscose (rayon) to linen, with their shoes being made of recyclable leather. All the cotton items, like their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Liza Ultra High Rise Straight Jeans</a>, are made of organic cotton. The Tencel lyocell, found in their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mason Short</a>, comes from eucalyptus trees, and only takes half an acre to produce an entire ton of fiber. Reformation finds alternative ways to farm, source, and produce their fabrics so that they create the least amount of eco-footprint on our planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why is Reformation popular?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More than just cute clothes, Reformation appeals to a wide range of people by hitting a trifecta of benefits. The sustainable business practices that still come at an attainable price make the brand shine. They go to numerous lengths to ensure a 360-degree ethical business, and we'd still consider the prices to be more affordable than what most sustainable businesses list their items for. But most importantly, the beautiful and flattering clothes set the brand apart the most. Layer on the fact that their fabrics feel substantial, thanks to their quality materials, and that longevity is guaranteed, it’s really no wonder why Reformation is so popular.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do Reformation dresses run small?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s a strong negative. As a matter of fact, Reformation dresses tend to run large, so sizing down is often required (but not always). Your safest bet is to order your true size, and then take advantage of their<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> free shipping and returns</a> if you need another size. I ordered true to size on the dresses, then sized down on their tops, and could have sized up for their jeans. It’s a bit of a waltz, therefore, to find the perfect size at Reformation.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer with over two years of experience covering fashion and beauty.

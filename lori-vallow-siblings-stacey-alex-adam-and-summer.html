Below you’ll briefly learn about her siblings and their relationship with each other.</p><p>Hence, tag along with this article Lori Vallow Siblings to learn more about them.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Lori Vallow Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Lori Vallow was born on 26 June 1973 into a devout Mormon family. She has three older and one younger sibling making a total of five children born to her parents Janis Lee Cox and Barry Lynn Cox. Janis and Barry reportedly tied the knots in 1965 in Sacramento. The kids were born in California in San Bernardino County – California based on the birth records which are public.</p><p>Lori was described by her high school friends as a “quiet,” “sweet” Southern California girl from a devout Mormon family who loved spending time with her cheerleading friends. She attended Eisenhower High School in Rialto, California. She had her squad and would often spend time in Lori’s house.</p><p>“As a cheer squad, we were always at Lori’s house. Her mom and dad let us hang out there. We used to swim,” Bernadette Flores-Lopez told Inside Edition. “Everybody was just so welcoming. They had a big family.” The Cox family were “very, very devout Mormons,”&nbsp;Flores-Lopez said, and Lori would attend religious education classes in the morning before school.</p><p>“That takes a lot of dedication, in high school, to go before school started to seminary,” Flores-Lopez said. “She never spoke about what it meant to be a Mormon or anything. I just know in her house, there was a giant book of the Book of Mormon.” Lori’s parents didn’t come to her cheer competitions, Flores-Lopez said, but that didn’t seem to bother Lori. They were a quiet family and kept pretty much to themselves, she said.</p><h3><strong>Meet Lori Vallow Sisters, Stacey & Summer Cox</strong></h3><p>Lori Vallow’s sisters Stacey Lynn Cox Cope was born on 17 June 1966 and her sister Summer Cox Shiflet was born on 23 September 1975. Sadly, Lori lost her sister on 21 May 1998 suddenly of undetermined cause. Stacey was the older sister of Lori Vallow.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Court TV</a>, the circumstances behind Stacey’s death is unclear. One of the guests on the show shared that the gravestone shown on the Court TV’s video was from when it was new. Now, it appears to be abandoned and no one has cared for it. The headstone located in San Antonio, Texas, was found plastered in dirt and seemed to have been left untended for years.</p><p>Stacey had a daughter named Melani Boudreaux Pawlowski who was an integral part of the case.</p><p>Melani also gave several <a href=#>interviews</a> to several news stations about the investigation process and her relationship with her cousin Daybell’s missing children (Joshua “JJ” Vallow and Tylee Ryan), and the death of her uncle Alex Cox (more on this later). Melani married her husband Ian Pawlowski in November 2019 and lived next door to Lori in Rexburg during the time her children were missing.</p><p>She is currently involved in a custody dispute with her ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux, regarding their four children. Brandon was shot at in October and believes Cox, his ex-wife’s uncle, was the shooter. She is currently residing in Arizona with her husband.</p><p>Moreover, Melani faced accusations of joining a cult Preparing A People along with her aunt. She denied the accusations later. The aim of the cult is to ready the Earth for the second coming of Christ.</p><p>Additionally, in court filings made as part of a custody battle between the pair and obtained by Fox10, Brandon states: “Melani is involved in a cult where numerous members, adults and children alike have been being killed off like flies. He continues: “Melani’s knowledge of the whereabouts of her aunt’s two missing children and her unwillingness to cooperate with law enforcement is daunting.”</p><p>Moving on, Summer Cox Shiflet is the other sister of Lori Vallow (Cox). After the incident of her missing niece and nephew, Summer took to <a href=#>Facebook</a> to admit that she was wrong to say harm would never come to her niece and nephew after they were found tortured and buried in Vallow’s husband’s backyard.</p><p>Since then, she has been posting a lot about her JJ and Tylee. Her latest post on Facebook dates back to <a href=#>September 2021</a>.</p><p>Summer is currently married to her husband Dr. Jeff Shiflet DC, a licensed Chiropractor serving Queen Creek and San Tan Valley communities. They married in August 2000 and shares three beautiful children and enjoy spending their time together as a family.</p><p>Jeff was born and raised in Safford, Arizona. Shortly after high school, he spent two years in New York City serving a mission for his church, where he grew to love the people and the Spanish language.</p><p>Dr. Shiflet is a 2001 graduate of Parker College of Chiropractic. While at Parker, Dr. Shiflet earned a Bachelor of Science in Anatomy, as well as his Doctor of Chiropractic degrees.</p><h3><strong>Meet Lori Vallow Brothers, Alex & Adam Cox</strong></h3><p>Starting with Alex Cox, authorities in Arizona released an <a href=#>audio phone call</a> between a detective and the ex-wife of Alex Cox, Lori’s brother. She told a police detective that her former husband Alex had a bizarrely sexual relationship with his Lori. The woman, identified only as “Debbie” in the recording, told police Cox regularly talked about how “hot” his sister was and said the two would often engage in “inappropriate sexual touching,” even in front of other family members.</p><p>Asked to clarify what she meant by “inappropriate,” Debbie said, “They were simulating sex acts, which is not normal to me for a brother and a sister. For example, he would pick her up and she would wrap her legs around his waist and he would kind of bounce her up and down on himself in front of me and they would moan and simulate sex acts.”</p><p>She said the family exhibited “no shame” and acted this way whenever they were together. The strange dynamic was what led Debbie to leave Alex just months after their marriage. “Alex and I only lived together for about four or five months and then I just knew that that family was too weird, that I had made a big mistake, and so I got out,” she said.</p><p>According to East Idaho News, Alex Cox had an ex-wife named Debbie. They tied the knots in 1992. The couple divorced less than a year later, but Debbie reportedly contacted the Chandler Police Department in September 2020, a few months after investigators found the bodies of Lori’s two children buried in the backyard of her Chad Daybell, her fifth husband.</p><p>But, Debbie added that she didn’t think they were sleeping together.</p><p>Alex reportedly died in 2019 from a blood clot, according to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office. The report, dated May 8, 2020, states the primary cause of death was “bilateral pulmonary thromboemboli”, a condition in which arteries in the lungs become blocked by blood clots.</p><p>Moreover, by profession, Alex was a massage therapist.</p><p>Alex <a href=#>reportedly</a> killed Lori’s fourth husband Charles Vallow on 11 July 2019 claiming the killing was in self-defense. Alex’s second wife is Zulema Pastenes. They married in Las Vegas.</p><p>Adam Cox, Lori’s second brother was born on 4 April 1969. When he appeared on ABC’s ’20/20: Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell’ he shared that he still remembers how happy and close they were while growing up in Southern California decades ago, especially with three other siblings.</p><p>In addition to swimming together, Adam allegedly taught her how to play basketball before watching her develop into a high school cheerleader and later became a mother. At the time, Adam never gave his sister much thought, but years later, when he saw that she had begun to adopt weird beliefs, he started to have serious concerns.</p><p>In truth, Lori had admitted to Adam months before the catastrophes that she had spoken to Jesus Christ “face to face” and that she was “turning&nbsp;into a translated being” who was immortal. He stared at his sister in disbelief and exclaimed, Lori, what you’re saying is not true; this is nonsense. And she goes, ‘You think I’m crazy, don’t you?'”&nbsp;At that point, Adam sought to clarify that what she was saying was “not normal,” but Lori didn’t listen and instead tried to permanently sever their connection. He then unsuccessfully attempted to get their mother to step in.</p><p>After the two children’s disappearance, Adam explained Lori’s demeanor. “Lori talked about death a lot actually, talked about the next life, how great the next life is and how it’s going to be perfect and how her kids won’t have to suffer in the next life,” Adam <a href=#>said</a> in The Followers: Madness of Two podcasts in 2021. “I thought, ‘If they’re good, Lori, you tell me where these kids are.’ If she says, ‘Well, I’m not going to tell you where the kids are,’ that means the kids aren’t alive.”</p><p>Furthermore, in 2022, Adam is currently residing in Wichita, Kansas. He has been on the radio for 30 years. Husband to his wife Nicole and dad to his son young adult son Zac, he is leading a happy family life. He has two dogs Reece and Molly, and they treat them like children, they sleep in the bed with them, and sometimes there is no room for Lukas.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Are Cox Siblings Today?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Lori’s brother Adam is living in Wichita, Kansas, and her sister Summer is in Arizona.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Do Cox Siblings Appear On Netflix’s Sins of Our Mother?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Lori’s brother Adam appears on Netflix’s Sins of Our Mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpaeinnq3rculprBlo56vrbXNoKpmq6SWsKbFjJqjnrBdlrGiuYyapZ1lo6q6rrHRaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-jeans-for-flat-butts.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Best Jeans for Flat Butts in 2024</a>

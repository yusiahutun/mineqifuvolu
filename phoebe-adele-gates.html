Moreover, her parents raised her with intensive care and proper discipline. While other children of her age tend to spoil their behaviors, Phoebe made sure she harnessed only good deeds.</p><p>Being a billionaire’s daughter would make anyone think that she has a perfect life. But in fact, she has been suffering from OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) from a young age.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1831 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bill-Gates-Phoebe-Adele-Gates.jpg alt="Image of Bill Gates's youngest daughter, Phoebe Adele Gates" width=700 height=503 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-1831 class=wp-caption-text>Phoebe Adele Gates</p><h2><strong>Phoebe Adele Gates Education and Early Life.</strong></h2><p>When someone is the child of a billionaire, they have the freedom of attending the finest and expensive institutes to gain a better education.

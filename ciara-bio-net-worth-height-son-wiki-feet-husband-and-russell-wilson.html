As a songwriter, she became professionally known in 2003. Since then this musical diva has released several albums (six studio albums) and many hit singles. Since the beginning of her career, Ciara has won numerous music awards, including the Grammy Awards. She has also introduced musicians like Ludacris, Justin Timberlake, Missy Elliot, Fatman Scoop and so many others.

But she would change that career path after seeing a musical show on television. She decided to become a musician and formed a singing group with her friends that she called “Hearsay”. The group recorded some songs but later disbanded due to irreconcilable differences between them. Ciara decided to continue her music career as a lone fighter and met the music producer Jazze Pha, who helped her get her very first contract with Laface Records in 2002. She wrote her first song Got Me Waiting for R&B singer, <a href=#>Fantasia Barrino</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ciara-Career.jpg><p>In 2004 she released her first single Goodie. The song went platinum and exceeded her expectations. Since then she has released more hit singles that have topped the US music charts. She immersed herself in acting, which was very successful. She starred in movies such as All You’ve Got, (2006) Mama, I Want To Sing (2012) and That’s My Boy (2012).</p><h2><strong>Is Russell Wilson Ciara’s Husband? Son</strong></h2><p>Ciara is currently married to Russell Wilson, a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, an American NFL franchise player. She met Russell Wilson, and the two met in 2015 and tied the wedding knot in a lavish ceremony in Cheshire, England, one year later, on July 6, 2016. Russell began playing football with his father and older brother at the age of 4. Since then he has been actively playing the game, winning many prizes and being considered one of the fastest in the game. The couple has a daughter, Sienna Princess Wilson.</p><p>The Grammy award winner had some relationships before her marriage to Wilson. She had met Bow Wow (2005-2007), 50 Cent (2007-2010), Ludacris (2008, during a break of 50 Cent), Amar’s Stoudemire (2010-2011), Trey Songz (2010), and Future (2012 -2014).</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Hamilton’s, Lin Manuel Miranda? What Do We Know About His Wife and Sons?</a></strong></p><p>Their relationship with the Future resulted in the birth of their son, Future Zahir Wilburn, who was born on 19 May 2014. Ciara and the rapper were engaged for two years and wanted to get married, but she broke off the engagement and accused him of cheating on her with his stylist. After the birth of her son she fought in court with the rapper for custody of the child, but later decided to get joint custody and spent more time with him, as Future was always on the road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ciara-and-Russell-Wilson-with-Son.jpg><p>Future Jr. has a knack for modeling. He stole the show at the Kid’s Choice Awards 2017 during his runway with Russell Wilson. He signed his first modeling contract with Gap Kids. Future Jr. promoted the “Back to School” apparel line for kids his age. Ciara was all emotional on social media, saying her son had moved her to tears and made her so proud. Ciara and her husband were active in social media and always posted pictures of them at home, on the beach, and on vacation.</p><h2><strong>Ciara Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The first hit by hip-hop and R&B artist Goodie from 2004 sold over 124,000 copies in the first week after its release. She earned just over $1 million and placed the hit at #3 out of 200 songs in the US Billboard Charts. Ciara won a 2006 Grammy Award for the best short-film music video with Lose Control. She has won other awards including Choice Awards, ASCAP Music Pop Awards, MTV Music Video Awards, and BET Awards. As an actress, she has starred in several films, all of which have also been successful. In 2016, she was named brand ambassador for Revlon cosmetics. She is currently worth just over $20 million.</p><h2><strong>How Big Are Ciara Feet? Height</strong></h2><p>Ciara is a very tall and sexy songbird, and she would stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest female musicians in the American entertainment industry. She has an athletic figure and stands at 5ft 8.5 inches. Her only flaw for her perfect build and body design was her feet. Ciara had an unladylike foot structure and was therefore harassed on social media, which led the hip hop artist to opt for a corrective surgery that would make her feet look more feminine and attractive to her fans. After a successful surgery, she uploaded images of her new feet to Instagram and received mixed reactions, with some of her fans loving and congratulating her on her redesigned feet, while others continued to physically embarrass her, claiming that her feet still looked like a man’s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKqt0Zpkm6GfYrumwIywpqusmGK1prXGoatmq5%2Bjeri1yqJkn52VqXqpwdKbmKecXZa7pXnRrqqsnZyheri1y6ymp2c%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gigi-hadid-next-in-fashion-season-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gigi Hadid brings her fashion A-game for her Next in Fashion Season 2 promo tour outfits</a>

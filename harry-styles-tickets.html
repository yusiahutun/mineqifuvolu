The tour—which is Styles’ second world tour after his “<a href=# id=auto-tag_harry-styles data-tag=harry-styles>Harry Styles</a>: Live on Tour” from 2017 to 201—is in support of Styles’ upcoming third studio album, Harry’s House, which was released on May 20, 2022.</p><p>On October 6, 2022, the United Center in Chicago announced that the October 6 show had to be rescheduled due to a crew member’s illness. “Out of an abundance of caution, tonight’s Harry Styles show on Thursday, October 6, 2022, at United Center has been rescheduled to Monday, October 10, 2022 due to band/crew illness,” the statement said, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">published on Twitter</a>. “All previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new date.

You realize that when you stop for a minute.” Styles also told the magazine about how his relationship with sex and sexuality has changed over the years.</p><p>“For a long time, it felt like the only thing that was mine was my sex life,” he said. “I felt so ashamed about it, ashamed at the idea of people even knowing that I was having sex, let alone who with. At the time, there were still the kiss-and-tell things. Working out who I could trust was stressful. But I think I got to a place where I was like, ‘Why do I feel ashamed? I’m a 26-year-old man who’s single’; it’s, like, yes, I have sex.”</p><p>Though Styles’ first two albums, <a href=# rel=noopener>Harry Styles</a> and Fine Line, hit number one on the Billboard 200 chart, Styles told Better Homes and Garden that he doesn’t feel the same pressure for Harry’s House to have similar success. “Finally, it doesn’t feel like my life is over if this album isn’t a commercial success,” he said. “I just want to make stuff that is right, that is fun, in terms of the process, that I can be proud of for a long time, that my friends can be proud of, that my family can be proud of, that my kids will be proud of one day.”</p><p>So where can fans buy <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Styles tickets</a> to his Love on Tour?

The album—which follows 2017’s Harry Styles and 2019’s Fine Line—features 13 tracks, including the single “As It Was” and songs “Boyfriend” and “Late Talking,” which Styles performed for the first time at the Coachella Valley <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>Music</a> and Arts Festival in April 2022.

And then you’re faced with a time when you can’t do that,” he said. “I kind of stopped for a second and looked at what I turned to listen to and what I was watching and all that kind of stuff and was like, ‘What does it actually mean to make something? And what does it mean to me to make something as my job?’”</p><p>Styles also told Apple Music about how he was “really lucky” to have his One Direction bandmates—Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik—to lean on in the early years of his career. “I think there is very much a respect between all of us, if we did something together. And that is something that you can’t really undo. And you know, it’s like a very deep love for each other, I think,” he said. He also explained the difference between touring as a solo artist and in a boy band.&nbsp;“It just felt so separate from any individual. It never felt like… You are never on stage being like, ‘Yeah, this stadium’s full because of me,'” he said. He continued of his own fans,“The crowd is so emotionally generous that they just want me to be having a good time, and I can feel that. Doing shows is my favorite thing to do in the world.”</p><p>Styles also credited Billie Eilish for re-inspiring his creativity. “I think being in the band, I’d always felt like we were really young… And I had a moment seeing [Billie] do this at such a young age where I felt like, ‘I’m not that young anymore.’ And for a while it was, how do you play that game of remaining exciting?” he said. Styles told Apple Music he was “thankful” for Eilish, saying she “broke the spell” of him overanlyzing his career decisions. “This is so unbelievably liberating to go, ‘I just want to make good music.’ That’s it. That’s what I want to do. And everything else is what it will be. And that’s kind of it,” he said.</p><p>He also told Apple Music about the inspiration for the title of his third album: Harry’s House. “I was kind of like, ‘I’d be really fun to make an album called Harry’s House,’ and thought about it being this smaller thing. And then it was back to that thing of, ‘Maybe that’s an album I’ll make in four years or five years or whatever.’ And as I started making the album, I realized it wasn’t about the geographical location. It’s much more of an internal thing,” he said. He described the sound of the album as&nbsp;“more electronic in a lot of places than anything I’ve made, it’s also so much more intimate to me. And so much more intimately made.”</p><h2>Who are Harry Styles’ Love on Tour opening acts?</h2><p>Who are Harry Styles’ Love on Tour opening acts?

According to the Times, she was treated at a rape crisis center later that day and sent the comedian&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>text messages&nbsp;</a>telling him that she felt he had taken advantage of her. “When a girl say[s] NO it means no,” one alleged text read, to which Brand purportedly replied that he was “very sorry.”</p><p>A second woman claims that she was only 16 years old when she was assaulted by Brand, who was 31 years old at the time. During their relationship, which lasted about three months, she said he referred to her as “the child” and asked her to read passages from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel,&nbsp;Lolita, which follows a predatory relationship between a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>middle-aged man</a>&nbsp;and a 12-year-old girl. The woman also alleged that Brand once “forced his penis down her throat” until she choked, and had to punch him in the stomach to make him stop.</p><p>A third woman alleged that he sexually assaulted her when they worked together in Los Angeles. According to the woman, Brand threatened to take legal action against her if she spoke up about her experience. The fourth woman also claimed she was sexually assaulted by Brand, and described the actor as being both physically and emotionally abusive during their relationship.</p><p>Since the airing of the documentary, The Met police said it had received an allegation of sexual assault in Soho, central London, in 2003, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. It added that as yet no investigation had been launched. In a short statement, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “We are aware of&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;by the Sunday Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches about allegations of sexual offences.</p><p>“On Sunday 17 September, the Met received a report of a sexual assault, which was alleged to have taken place in Soho in central London in 2003. Officers are in contact with the woman and will be providing her with support.</p><p>“We first spoke with the Sunday Times on Saturday 16 September and have since made further approaches to the Sunday Times and Channel 4 to ensure that anyone who believes they have been the victim of a sexual offence is aware of how to report this to the police.</p><p>“We continue to encourage anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a sexual offence, no matter how long ago it was, to contact us.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-has-russell-brand-responded>How has Russell Brand responded?</h2><p>A day before the reveal, Brand posted a three-minute-long, rambling&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram video&nbsp;</a>defending himself.</p><p>“I’ve received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks,” he began the video. “But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”</p><p>He continued, “These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies,” he shared. “And as I’ve written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual. I was always transparent about that then—almost too transparent. And I’m being transparent about it now as well. And to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal, that I absolutely deny.”</p><p>While he did not name the Times or Channel 4 explicitly, he called out media groups for using his experiences to “attack” him. “I don’t mind them using my books and my stand-up to talk about my promiscuous, consensual conduct in the past.</p><p>“What I seriously refute are these very, very, serious criminal allegations,” he went on to add. “Also, it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently, in what seems to me to be, a coordinated attack.”</p><p>Though he didn’t address what happened due to the “serious nature,” he did make his stance clear. “I feel like I’m being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together,” he shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWZpfnN9lWifqK9dqbxuw8CtmqFloqrAtLHLpWSbqpGjsW61zWanpZmZo3q0tcahq2ahnmLCtHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./its-time-buy-mooncakes-which-brand.html>&#171;&nbsp;It's time to buy mooncakes - but which brand?</a>

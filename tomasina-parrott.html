She holds American nationality.</p><p>The name and information regarding her father and mother are not available at the moment. Similarly, information related to her other family members such as her siblings, cousins, grandparents, and any other family members is also not available now.</p><p>It seems as if she likes to keep her personal and family life private and away from the limelight and the public. That might be the reason why she barely talks about them in front of the public.</p><p>Regarding her educational background and qualifications, she graduated from Robert A. Millikan High School in Long Beach in the year 1995. However, information about her further studies is not known.</p><p>But considering her age and background, she must have graduated from university as well until and unless she is a dropout or decides to quit further studies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-94724 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tomasina-Parrott-Larenz.jpg alt="Tomasina Parrott" width=650 height=340 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-94724 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tomasina and her husband (Source: AmoMama)</p><h2><span id=Tomasina_Parrott_8211_Body_Measurements>Tomasina Parrott – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Tomasina Parrott has a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 7 inches and her weight is 62 Kg.

This music video dealt with the subject of domestic abuse.</p><p>She has put her dancer days behind her. She has switched to another of her talents as a profession. Moreover, she is now the owner and baker of the “Sugar Fairy Bake Shop” in Calabasas.

There’s Whitstable with its candy-coloured beach huts and genteel clientele; Broadstairs and its sweeping sandy beaches, seemingly borrowed from across the channel; Margate, now a gentrified gathering place for hipsters; and Dungeness, its barren seascapes popular with artists and students back from university. Then you have Folkestone, the scrappy underdog with its growing art scene and seafront pubs where locals stare with fleeting suspicion as you walk inside.

Anyone who arrives at Folkestone Central expecting sandy beaches and colourful architecture will be disappointed; the two most prominent buildings that greet visitors are the Saga HQ building and a supersized Asda. This isn’t a town overburdened with visual charm, although its regeneration has given at least parts a facelift. Folkestone is no Brighton, Whitby or Falmouth – and that’s no bad thing.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0192-1558710635.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was the Channel Tunnel that finally spelt the end of days for Folkestone. At the start of the 20th century, the town was a thriving port and a popular holiday destination among royalty and the British elite. Agatha Christie wrote Murder on the Orient Express from the town’s Grand Hotel, and King Edward VII apparently spent so much time there that locals would peer into his hotel to spy on him and his mistress, Alice Keppel. The first and second world wars weren’t great for business and, if ever there was a fact to illustrate how unlucky Folkestone has been over the years, it’s that the Germans used to drop their leftover bombs on the town before they headed home. The '60s and '70s welcomed overseas travel for the masses and Folkestone slipped into decline. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 meant that its port was more redundant than ever before.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b9665-1558711813.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have always loved Folkestone, having grown up in a village only 15 minutes away. I like the regeneration of it, but only because it seems to be an example of one of the few seaside towns that has managed to do so in a respectful way. The locals are still included and it hasn’t tried to arrogantly recreate Peckham by sea, then blithely, righteously quip that it’s boosting the local economy through seasonal employment or by erecting craft breweries that the locals can’t afford to drink in. These things exist, but in tandem with services that benefit those who have always lived there: a multi-storey skate park and climbing centre, subsidised for children attending local schools, an affordable open-air entertainment hub, and multiple cultural festivals, spanning documentaries to books.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0410-1558711011.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike some of Kent’s more aesthetically gifted seaside destinations, such as Whitstable and Broadstairs, Folkestone radiates a stoic, dour quality that is so singular to the coastal towns that were once popular; if you’d spent centuries being battered by storms and icy, salty water, being picked up and dropped by DFLs (Down From London-ers), you’d be pretty grumpy too. Its high street – not the cobbled stone-covered ‘creative quarter’ – isn’t much to look at (although I challenge you not to enjoy the Italian ice cream at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bello-Gelato/400696473323338 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="La Casa Del Bello Gelato" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">La Casa Del Bello Gelato</a>). Indeed, Folkestone remains steadfastly and resolutely plain in comparison to its quaint postcard-perfect siblings further along the coast. This is a place where Banksy created a mural and a resident spray-painted a penis over the top of it. And yet, despite itself, Folkestone has always possessed certain charms, such as the majestic Leas, a picturesque clifftop promenade overlooking the sea. It was designed in the mid-1800s by Decimus Burton, who also worked on buildings and landscapes at London Zoo and Kew Gardens, which gives you an indication of its visual prowess. In the middle stands a Victorian bandstand, surrounded by deckchairs in the summer. Folkestone has a lot of crummy hotels (read the TripAdvisor reviews of the Grand Burstin Hotel if ever you want a good giggle), but <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.grand-uk.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Grand" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Grand</a> on the Leas is unarguably beautiful – a century-old building designed in the town’s sunniest spot with towering windows and views looking across the ocean to France.</p><img alt="folkestone anthony gormley" title="Folkestone " width=5628 height=3752 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0511-1558711149.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>Anthony Gormley’s human statue under the Harbour Arm</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have fond memories of being treated to a ride in the Grade II-listed Leas Lift, which during the '40s and '50s carried thousands of tourists every day to and from the promenade to the seafront. It was closed in 2016 for health and safety reasons, but there are plans to restore it back to its former glory later this year. If you carry on walking along the seafront you’ll reach the Lower Leas Coastal Park, which boasts the largest free adventure play area in the South East. There’s an amphitheatre that hosts children’s workshops, live music, opera and theatre, some of which are free; Shakespeare’s Henry V is on the agenda for this summer.</p><img alt=folkestone title=Folkestone width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sunny-sands-1558711251.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>The Folkestone Mermaid by Cornelai Parker on Sunny Sands</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the other side of town, you’ll find Sunny Sands – a small, but perfectly formed sandy beach overlooked by grassy hills decorated with wild thyme and flowers.

In fact, he continued, his vista was so pretty that he found himself distracted constantly and barely wrote anything. If you keep walking beyond the hills, you’ll come to The Warren and the East Cliffs, in which overgrown grassy meadows descend to a usually empty pebble and sand beach below. It’s overgrown now, but I like that about it – there’s nothing manicured or polished about this side of town. Steep grassy corridors of foliage and rock sea lavender lead down to the sea and the tiny bays themselves look out across to the White Cliffs of Dover. A rare colony of Grayling butterflies has made the Warren its home. You can swim here, but the water will be freezing so approach with caution.</p><img alt=folkestone title=Folkestone width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0109-1558711388.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>Lubaina Himid Jelly Mould Pavilion</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A lot has been said about Folkestone’s rising arts scene. This small coastal town has the largest urban outdoor collection of contemporary art in the UK. The changing exhibition currently consists of 74 artworks by 46 artists, most of which have designed their respective piece with the exact site in mind. Think a treasure hunt of outdoor art and you won’t be far off. There’s Cornelia Parker’s mermaid sculpture, which sits high on the rock above Sunny Sands; under the Harbour Arm’s arches stands Anthony Gormley’s cast-iron human statue, which resolutely stares out to the sea; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/bazaar-art/a40867294/lubaina-himid-flag-art-foundation-prize/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lubaina Himid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lubaina Himid</a> – the first Black woman to ever receive the Turner Prize – created a giant ceramic jelly mould where Folkestone’s former fairground, The Rotunda, used to be; and then there’s my favourite, Richard Woods’ Holiday Home, six colourful, cartoon-like bungalows that are dotted in unusual or unlikely spots around the town – in the middle of the shingle beach, floating in the sea, or perched on top of rocks in a carpark – to open a discussion about second homes. The idea is that no site is too small, too unlikely, or too inconvenient for its neighbours, for a holiday home. Art superstars are drawn to this town in their droves; Tracey Emin, Yoko Ono and David Shrigley have all created public works here.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is an argument that the long-standing locals couldn’t care less about public art, but there is a singular quality about these installations that eludes a typical art gallery, which people often feel intimidated by. Public art is inclusive – whether you decide to engage with it or not is entirely up to you.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0491-1558711491.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>Richard Woods’ Holiday Home</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My favourite way to do Folkestone is to start at the harbour. You could eat at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rocksaltfolkestone.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Rocksalt class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rocksalt</a>, the town’s Michelin-starred restaurant, but you’d be daft to miss the fresh prawns and crab sticks at seafood stall <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/chummys/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Chummys class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Chummys</a>. If the weather’s bad, head along the cobbled road and under the railway arch to The Ship Inn for hearty pub food in a warming, cosy setting. The fish and chips are particularly good. Afterwards, walk across the new landscaped walkway to the Harbour Arm – one of Folkestone’s biggest recent success stories and an example of gentrification done respectfully. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://folkestoneharbourarm.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Harbour Arm" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Harbour Arm</a> was originally a railway terminal (and also a departure point for soldiers on their way to the Western Front), but remained desolate and unused until five years ago, when it was regenerated. Now, it’s peppered with independent food and drink trucks and stands that span Greek food to excellent flat bread pizzas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Live music is a big part of the activity down on 'The Arm', as the locals call it, and there’s no fee to watch any of it. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://folkestoneharbourarm.co.uk/folkestone-marketplace/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Marketplace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Marketplace</a>, spread out over 35 fisherman huts, offers an ever-evolving range of homewares, crafts, clothing and wellness products. Picnic benches, tables and deckchairs look out across the sea to the majestic White Cliffs of Dover. In The Good Yard, a huge screen shows a mix of sports and films. The plaza-like space also hosts regular gigs and DJ sets. Next door, The Pilot Bar – set out on the beach – is an idyllic spot for a cocktail or a coffee. Yes, there’s the family-run <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://folkestoneharbourarm.co.uk/outlets/lighthouse-champagne-bar/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="champagne lighthouse" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">champagne lighthouse</a> at the end of the arm, which plays a mix of reggae, blues and funk vinyl, but the best thing about the Harbour Arm is that people from Folkestone actually use it. There are as many people drinking canned beer and sandwiches bought from Asda in the town centre, as there are tourists. Everyone is invited to watch the live music, soak up the atmosphere and look out to sea.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b9939-1558711578.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>The Harbour Arm in Folkestone</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once you’ve walked up and down the arm, explore the Old High Street or the ‘Creative Quarter’ as it’s now called, which offers a mix of colourful independent shops, cafés and bars – from record and vintage shops to galleries selling unusual neon artworks.

Its owners, Paul and Karen Rennie, have such in-depth knowledge and a contagious enthusiasm for every single item in their shop. You won’t want to leave this tiny cabin of unique curiosities. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.kittymccall.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kitty McCall" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kitty McCall</a>'s shop on adjacent Tontine Street is also a worthy stop-off; a colourful, mood-boosting treasure chest of homewares, artworks and textiles.</p><img alt="Folkestone Rennies" title=Folkestone width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0326-1558711650.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>Paul Rennie, owner of Rennies Seaside Modern</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a steep hill up the Old High Street, but a pretty one – each of the buildings are painted different colours – and a lot of the cafés and bars double up as performance spaces that host talks, workshops and gigs.

As nice as the Pullman is, I still prefer the British Lion which is about two minutes’ walk away in a picturesque, secluded spot called The Bayle. The British Lion is thought to be the oldest pub in Folkestone with parts going back to the 1500s and was a favourite of Dickens' when he visited. It’s a snug, welcoming place that locals love and is decorated with dried hops that hang from the beams. End your day here with a pint at the bar or hunker down in one of the booths.</p><img alt=Folkestone title=Folkestone width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2e8b0311-1558711955.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Poppy Hollis</span><p>Sentient art gallery near Folkestone’s Old High Street</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps part of the reason I love Folkestone so much is that it’s where I first fell in love as young teenager. It makes me happy because it reminds me of a time when I was madly happy – that unique form of mad happy that only happens with intense, first love. I remember my first kiss in the then-dilapidated Silver Screen Cinema and long days spent at the Warren or Sunny Sands, usually slightly cold and damp but never minding much. I remember listening to garage compilations in his room recorded off the radio and running through town singing them. I remember proms in run-down venues wearing dresses bought on sale at TK Maxx. Maybe I’ve looked at this grumpy little town with rose-tinted glasses ever since.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not as uninviting as it used to be, but it’s as genuine and hardy as ever.

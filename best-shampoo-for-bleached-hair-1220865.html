This means that your hair is more or less bound to lose its natural shine and strength. The shampoos in our list above try their best to give your color-treated hair that hydration and nourishment back. Because as most cases go, caring for bleached hair starts at home, by setting up a routine that heals, protects, and prolongs the life of your color. Here are a few things to take into account when picking the shampoo for your newly bleached hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Understand the Problem</strong><br>Often, color-treated hair might act differently, especially when it has been a few weeks since your last salon visit. In such cases, it is important to take a closer look at how your hair in particular behaves. For some this might mean more brittleness or even split ends, for others, it could be yellowing tones, frizzy or rough hair. Once you understand your specific problem areas, it becomes easier to find a solution as most shampoos might directly focus on treating them.&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor, Kate Ross, Hair and Beauty Specialist - ‘Irresistible Me’, shares a few tips to maintain the color of bleached hair without fading it out with frequent shampooing.&nbsp;</p><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo formulated for color-treated hair.</li><li>Use dry shampoo in between washes</li><li>Rinse your hair with cool water to seal the cuticles</li><li>Use a purple shampoo once a week to neutralize brassiness</li><li>Apply a color-depositing conditioner or a gloss to refresh your tone.</li><p><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As your hair has already been treated with a lot of chemicals, it would be a smart move to look for healthier options to maintain your colored hair. When choosing shampoos you can take a pick from a host of naturally derived ingredients ranging from coconut oil, aloe vera extracts, argan oil, jojoba oil, and even biotin or keratin infusions. Find the right combination of ingredients that work for you, the more organic the better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommendations&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As they say, a friend in need is a friend indeed, you can take some heart from the varied customer reviews on the internet. You’d be quite surprised to find so many people who suffer from the exact issues that you’ve been suffering from. Their solutions and choices can be quite inspiring when it comes to choosing your shampoo.&nbsp;</p><p>While bleaching your hair may seem like a fun makeover, it comes with a slippery slope of adverse effects that range from brittleness, dullness, breakage, hair loss, and damaged follicles. But using a shampoo that specifically focuses on the aftercare of bleached hair will ensure that your hair shaft remains uncompromised. Our contributor, Kate Ross, suggests the use of conditioner “It's ideal to use shampoos with conditioners for bleached hair. Shampoos alone can make the bleached hair even more dry and brittle. Conditioners can help restore moisture, smoothness, and elasticity to the hair. They can also protect the hair from further damage and enhance the color vibrancy.”We recommend buying yourself the best shampoos for bleached hair that are created with the main motive of caring for colored hair and ensuring that your hair never loses its charm while offering your tresses a nourished and healthy look.</p><p>These shampoos are infused with some incredible naturally derived and organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, parabens, and toxic chemicals that can cause further hair damage. Instead, they will give your hair a thoroughly replenishing regimen as you get ready to take over the world with your lustrous locks. Once you begin following their use religiously as per the directions of usage, the end result is you’d get to enjoy a truly fabulous experience with your new hairdo. We assure you that these shampoos are so good for your blonde hair that you’d be soon saying, “Bleach please!”</p><p><strong>Contributor: </strong>Professional Hairstylist,&nbsp; Christopher Wenzel</p><p>Kate Ross, Hair and Beauty Specialist - <a href=#>Irresistible Me</a></p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Can I use any shampoo on my bleached hair?</p><p>Well, the short answer is probably not. Your bleached hair and its shade are unique to you. Similarly, it is important to choose a shampoo that suits your hair and helps elevate it more rather than causing any further damage.</p><p>What shampoo to avoid after bleaching hair?</p><p>Considering that your hair has already been treated with a substantial amount of chemicals, it is smart to steer clear of shampoos that have more chemicals in them.

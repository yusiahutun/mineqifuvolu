a court verdict concludes a contentious custody battle between two mothers; and pent-up tensions erupt in a life-altering family meltdown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a32226809/little-fires-everywhere-season-2-news-cast-spoilers-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="no plans for a second season" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">no plans for a second season</a> (yet), that's officially a wrap on the miniseries based on Celeste Ng's hit 2017 novel. But how exactly did the ending reflect that of its source material? Here, we briefly lay it all out.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who Starts the Fire?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the show:</strong> It's the Richardson kids. In the final moments, Izzy, the youngest of the Richardson siblings, is broken after learning Mia and Pearl are moving out of town. Mia, a rule-breaking artist, had become a mentor and mother figure to Izzy, who felt like an outcast in her own mother's strict, rule-abiding, and idealistic household. Losing Mia, on top of her mother's resentment and the bullying she endures at school, pushes Izzy to her limits. Desperate to start anew, she takes a can of gasoline and plans to set her room—and her house—on fire, but her siblings stop her before she can do so. The confrontation escalates into a screaming match between Izzy and her mother, Elena, who ultimately admits, "Do you think I wanted a daughter like you? I never wanted you in the first place." Izzy then decides to run away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her siblings, Lexie, Trip, and Moody, are disgusted by their mom's ugly revelation. They realize they don't want to end up like her. They finish what Izzy started, setting each of their rooms on fire, but they make sure their mother gets out of the house safely. When a fire chief asks Elena who started the blaze, she covers for her kids and says it was her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the book:</strong> Izzy starts it all. Like she is in the show, Izzy is dejected after learning that Mia and Pearl have left, and that her family is to blame. One night, she dumps a can of gasoline onto her sister Lexie's bed (Lexie is staying at a friend's house), strikes a match, lets the house burn, and runs away.</p><img alt='little fires everywhere "find a way" episode 108 elena’s bombshell reveal to pearl threatens to forever damage pearl’s relationship with her mother moody finds out about trip and pearl, feeling betrayed the jury reaches a divisive verdict which triggers a series of explosive, catastrophic events, which leads to five of our characters leaving shaker for good trip jordan elsass, moody gavin lewis, lexie jade pettyjohn and izzy megan stott, shown photo by erin simkinhulu' title="Find A Way" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-lfe-richardsons-finale-1587746073.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erin Simkin/Hulu</span></p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Happens with Mirabelle/May Ling?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the show:</strong> The judge sides with the McCulloughs. After a brutal court battle, Linda and Mark McCullough win custody of baby May Ling, whom they adopted after her birth mother, Bebe Chow, abandoned her at a fire station. Bebe is crushed and Mia comforts her at her apartment. Later that night, after the McCulloughs go to bed with May Ling (renamed Mirabelle) at home, Linda wakes up in the middle of the night to find that the baby is gone. A later scene finds Bebe in a car, reunited with May Ling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the book:</strong> The McCulloughs also win custody of Mirabelle/May Ling, but it's unclear that Bebe kidnaps her. Her last appearance in the book notes that she watches her daughter from outside the McCulloughs' house, waiting for the lights to turn off.</p><img alt='little fires everywhere "find a way" episode 108 elena’s bombshell reveal to pearl threatens to forever damage pearl’s relationship with her mother moody finds out about trip and pearl, feeling betrayed the jury reaches a divisive verdict which triggers a series of explosive, catastrophic events, which leads to five of our characters leaving shaker for good bill joshua jackson, linda rosemarie dewitt and mark geoff stults, shown photo by erin simkinhulu' title="Find A Way" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-lfe-mccolloughs-1587746051.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erin Simkin/Hulu</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Lexie's Abortion Is Revealed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the show:</strong> During the court case, Elena is determined to find dirt on Bebe Chow to help her friend Linda's case. She goes to a Planned Parenthood, hoping to learn if Bebe had visited the facility while pregnant. While snooping through documents, she discovers "Pearl Warren" had an abortion, but doesn't know that it was actually her daughter, Lexie, using Pearl's name as an alias. She visits Mia to break the news, but Mia tells her what really happened: that Lexie had the abortion under Pearl's name then stayed with the Warrens after the procedure while Elena was out of town. Elena kicks Mia and Pearl out of the apartment. Later that night, during the Richardsons' big family argument, Lexie confirms to her mother that she had an abortion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the book:</strong> Mia doesn't tell Elena what Lexie did. But she does leave hints of it behind after she and Pearl leave Shaker. After the Richardsons' house burns down, they shack up in the rental apartment where the Warrens stayed. They find artworks that Mia left behind, reflecting each Richardson family member. Lexie's piece includes part of the pink medical slip from her Planned Parenthood appointment. (In the series, Mia's parting art piece is a whited-out model town of Shaker with a giant golden bird cage in the center, holding one of Izzy's earrings inside.)</p><img alt='little fires everywhere "find a way" episode 108 elena’s bombshell reveal to pearl threatens to forever damage pearl’s relationship with her mother moody finds out about trip and pearl, feeling betrayed the jury reaches a divisive verdict which triggers a series of explosive, catastrophic events, which leads to five of our characters leaving shaker for good lexie jade pettyjohn, shown photo by erin simkinhulu' title="Find A Way" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-lfe-lexie-1587746034.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erin Simkin/Hulu</span></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where Do Mia and Pearl Go?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the show:</strong> Mia's childhood home.

There’s certainly no shortage of food advice when it comes to weight issues. And yet, diet alone isn’t the answer for most people’s weight challenges. That’s one why the weight-loss community took notice when a team of researchers at the University of Palermo in Italy reviewed scientific studies and concluded that, when inhaled through the nose <a href=#>essential oils can help reduce body fat</a>. “Smelling your way thin may sound too good to be true, but exciting new research shows that certain scents trigger weight loss,” confirms <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Schoffro Cook, PhD</a>, a board-certified doctor of natural medicine and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Essential Oils Healing Deck</a>. That’s right: It’s now possible to target body fat by using aromatic essential oils. Read on for the best essential oils for weight loss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Essential oil basics</h2><p>Many of us are familiar with the essential oils we can mix with carrier oils and apply to our skin like perfume and/or essential oil diffusers that make our homes smell nice. But what’s not so widely known is how effectively these scents also deliver powerful&nbsp;health benefits. (Click through to learn how <a href=#>essential oils improve focus, memory and more</a>.)</p><p>In the most basic terms, essential oils are simply highly concentrated plant extracts. Imagine taking a lavender plant, drying it, then steaming it until its pure oil separates from the plant and becomes a vapor that can be collected.</p><p>Hundreds of essential oils have been identified, and each can affect our health in different ways, explains Schoffro Cook. Essential oils work on the body much like a game of “telephone,” where a message is passed from person to person down a line. First, receptors in the nose sense the special chemicals in a particular oil’s scent. Then the message is sent to the central nervous system, which then passes the message to the brain to instruct other systems of the body to take action. One message might be to boost metabolism, resulting in a breakdown of fats around the belly. Another message might be to regulate hunger hormones or improve digestion.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Eucalyptus Oil Is One of Nature’s Best Virus Killers, Says A Growing Body Of Research</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Essential oils for weight loss</h2><p>Schoffro Cook says, “Most people are familiar with using essential oils for their bath and beauty benefits, but when it comes to health, essential oils are among the most powerful medicines available, helping assist in weight management.” Weight-loss expert <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorge Cruise</a>, author of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cruise Control Diet</a>, agrees, adding: “Incorporating essential oils into your daily life can be a delightful way to whittle your waist.”</p><p>California entrepreneur <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristi Glowski</a> is living proof of the slimming power of essential oils.

But regardless of what comprises our outfit, be it smart casual or business formal, comfort is imperative, especially when it comes to our feet. The good news? Work heels that won’t leave you aching by the end of the day are no longer just of the orthopedic variety, with plenty of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trend-minded brands</a> now putting their sartorial spin on functional footwear, thoughtfully designed with sensible heel heights and widths, as well as fancy features like arch support and plush cushioning.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Cyber Week Deals</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help determine the best options out there, we read through countless customer reviews and consulted a team of workwear style experts and a podiatrist.

This sleek, square-toe pump checks all the boxes for day-long comfort. For starters, its 2.5-inch block heel provides much more support and stability than a stiletto. Moreover, it boasts proprietary pressure-regulating plush insoles, an embedded heel cushion to absorb impact, pressure-distributing foam at the ball of the foot, and cradling and stabilizing arch support — all at a price point that’s slightly under most other options with similar technology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciate that it’s available in three different foot widths — slim, standard, and roomy — for a more accurate fit, though it’s worth noting that its size range doesn’t go below a size 6 or above a size 10.5. It also comes in five stunning colorways (think mocha brown croc and buttery-soft black suede) that are neutral enough to get a ton of wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper, lining, and sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Size: </strong>6–10.5; slim, standard, and roomy width | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-block-heeled-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Block-Heeled Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Block-Heeled Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_A-2EPvqv5D8iN4j_imDkkti3yo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HM-Block-Heeled-Pumps-5d3bc57c84484f9dbc74f4e1c959c232.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Minimalist in design, this shoe allows for plenty of styling versatility.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not available in half sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A solid pair of work heels shouldn’t have to break the bank. Case in point? This block-heeled pump from H&M. The silhouette is clean and simple, and there are plenty of thoughtfully designed features that make this shoe a winner in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The thicker heel distributes weight and pressure more evenly across the foot than a standard stiletto, while its angular slant gives it a high-fashion feel. The squared toe is not just another trendy design element; it also provides more wiggle room for toes than a classic point, meaning you’ll be way more comfortable throughout the day. However, given the higher height of the heel and lack of footbed cushioning, we recommend placing a memory foam insert over the insole if your work day comprises standing for long periods of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester lining; polyurethane upper, sock, and sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>4–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3.25 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-reformation-mallori-closed-toe-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Versatile</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Mallori Closed Toe Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Mallori Closed Toe Heel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RmcByEOY9dIddsz3H9eRhanfC98=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Mallori-Closed-Toe-Heel-db61251382694dd696656cc520f11ff6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Lustrous patent leather and an ankle strap add an air of dressiness to these simple block heels.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It has no cushioning or arch support.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Given that work schedules are often packed with after-work activities like client dinners and team drinks, we appreciate any shoe that can easily transition from day to night, like this sweet style from Reformation. It features plenty of design elements that ensure day–long comfort —&nbsp; an extra-wide mid-height block heel for even weight distribution, a rounded toe that won’t smush your toes, and ankle support for better stability — but the shiny patent leather, delicate ankle strap, and low, open vamp deem it just as apt for a night out on the town (it also begs to be paired with a frilly white sock, if you ask us). Plus, the brand’s transparency surrounding its sustainability practices gives us all the more reason to click “add to cart.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>50 millimeters</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-amina-muaddi-ami-lambskin-pedestal-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amina Muaddi Ami Lambskin Pedestal Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neiman Marcus Amina Muaddi Ami Lambskin Pedestal Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lZJPG6UsqelSP4qZiHqxc3GSdVs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Amina-Muaddi-Ami-Lambskin-Pedestal-Pumps-498725b3150b4b87a65588566328dafd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This style is a fun twist on a classic silhouette.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to invest in a pair of work heels, opt for something that’s classic enough to wear for years to come but possesses some interesting detail or element of surprise that makes them stand out and, thus, worthy of their higher price tag. Amina Muaddi’s Ami pumps do just that, putting a twist on a tried-and-true silhouette by adding the brand’s signature flared pedestal heel for a shoe that feels polished and refined yet makes just enough of a statement apt for the office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quality is important, too, and the Paris-designed, Italian-made brand offers true luxury and superior craftsmanship. The pedestal heel also helps distribute weight more evenly, like a block heel, but at 3.75 inches, it’s definitely on the higher side. Without any added cushioning or arch support, it may not be ideal if your job keeps you on your feet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Lambskin leather upper and lining; leather and rubber outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–13 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pump-margaux-the-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pump</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Margaux The Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Margaux The Heel " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5RRKJCq5K9vjRVDLXZlgVfKl8oY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/margaux-the-heel-1bb9e362839a46e48aa66bff5250c11c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Margaux</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It features 5 millimeters of cushy foam padding and molds to your foot over time.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Pre-orders take up to 12 weeks to ship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Traditional pumps have a not-so-great reputation for being uncomfortable, but Margaux’s M.O. is creating stylish, thoughtfully designed footwear that’s anything but. The Heel is the brand’s take on the classic work heel, and it’s garnered a cult following for good reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It features 5 millimeters of plush foam padding, the brand’s signature comfortable 2.5-inch block heel, and a structured, supportive fit that molds to your foot over time. The style is offered in a super-inclusive size range, which, in addition to spanning a size 3 to a size 14, includes three different widths, and the brand even offers a free <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>concierge service</a> to ensure you find your best fit.

While it’s not a true block heel, the wider, flared base acts similarly to distribute pressure more evenly across the heel, while the lower height equates to a lower chance of aches and pains after a long day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Comfort aside, the silhouette is a sleek and modern twist on the classic pump that’s still just as versatile. Plus, the longer, pointed toe can actually help the legs look longer, which is always a plus. We also appreciate the brand’s commitment to selecting lower-impact materials for all its shoes and accessories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>EU36–EU40 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>60 millimeters</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mule-sanctuary-all-night-mule></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mule</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sanctuary All Night Mule</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Sanctuary All Night Mule" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MOxui4xqPi86lSLDG5hP0ItyDsI=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sanctuary-All-Night-Mule-1315f61b9fda4d738d216b53d80de5f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It features a memory foam insole for added comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The pointed toe may cause pain over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re dealing with any sort of tendon pain in the back of your heel, you’ll appreciate the open-back silhouette of the mule. It won’t rub or irritate the tendons, and it also rules out the chance of developing painful heel blisters. Foot pain aside, it's a simply an easy, effortless style that looks polished and professional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These mules from Sanctuary are made for long days at the office (and long nights out afterward), thanks to a cushy memory foam insole and lower kitten heel. And while the design itself is minimalist, the geometric hardware makes these feel slightly more dressed up, another reason to wear them day-to-night. We also love that the brand ensures that at least 50 percent of the leather used in its major components is sourced from a Leather Working Group-rated tannery for responsible energy and waste practices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper and lining; synthetic sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slingback-larroud-ines-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slingback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Larroudé Ines Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Larroud&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; Ines Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ix84cDA8jYqATGA0Muedyipb3WY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Larroude-Ines-Pump-e46f23883c424be3ab8bd4ed1217dbdd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>LarroudÃ©</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It features a memory foam insole for added comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The velvet upper isn’t functional for rainy days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s much to love about these sleek little slingbacks from It girl-favorite brand Larroudé. For starters, slingbacks provide a similar open-back airiness as a mule but with the added support of a singular strap, making them a practical choice for days you’ll be spending a lot of time on your feet. The Ines Pump happens to also be designed with a cushioned memory foam insole and a modest mid-heel to ensure your feet aren’t aching by the end of the day. We’re eyeing the burgundy velvet style as we approach the holiday season, but for a more practical, everyday option, it also comes in more wearable shades of black, ivory, and silver leather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Velvet upper, leather sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mary-jane-charles--keith-pointed-toe-mary-jane-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mary Jane</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charles & Keith Pointed-Toe Mary Jane Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charles &amp;amp; Keith Pointed-Toe Mary Jane Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ls315CZcWP5o6cztokb6wjT4aNY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Charles--Keith-Pointed-Toe-Mary-Jane-Pumps-8820e12bf76247168791510cf6d117f0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charles & Keith</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pumps are an affordable way to try a trendier style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The pointed toe may be uncomfortable for toes over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Mary Janes has made a comeback in recent seasons, and the sensible shoe also happens to be a great option for work given its polished appearance. We’re partial to this metallic pair from Charles & Keith — it comes with a pretty reasonable price tag, a plus for anyone looking to try out the trend without breaking the bank.

But they’re not just pretty to look at — in general, wedges are a great option for the office due to how well they support the feet. “They provide the height of a traditional heel but with much more comfort and stability, making them an excellent choice for anyone who’s on their feet all day,” says Leitz. They also feature a cushioned footbed with arch support for additional comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather or genuine calf-hair upper; synthetic lining; and rubber sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3.25 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-block-heel-everlane-the-italian-leather-day-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Block Heel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Italian Leather Day Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Italian Leather Day Heel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R6xvmCRTcoeFvrjZK7zpff-Lb6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-day-heel-28b89842e7e142f3b31ef4f2212cd4b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It features an elasticized back for extra comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This shoe has a narrow fit, which may be uncomfortable for those with wider feet, and sizing is somewhat inconsistent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A block heel is one of the most foot-friendly shoe options for anyone required to be on their feet all day yet still wants a bit of height. Providing much more support and stability than its stiletto counterparts, it helps reduce the amount of pressure put on your feet — meaning a much lower chance of aches and pains by the end of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everlane’s Day Heel is a solid choice, given its easy-to-style color offering, rounded toe cap (no squished toes here!), and 2-inch heel — the height maximum recommended by podiatrist Dr. Sondema N. Tarr, DPM, for comfortable wear. Bonus points for the elasticized backing that stretches around your heel rather than digging into it, avoiding the heel pain and blistering we often associate with closed-back shoes. (If you’ve ever worn a stiff flat or loafer all day before properly breaking them in, you know what we’re talking about.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-loafer-aeyde-anka-leather-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Loafer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aeyde Anka Leather Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Net-A-Porter Aeyde Anka Leather Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7dy5H4p3nFXR9uTUZTBo11U-908=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aeyde-Anka-Leather-Loafers-8e6f91283eef4735b5ddbb430edeb2cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The extra-chunky block heel provides great support and pressure distribution.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The style doesn’t have any arch support or cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d be remiss not to include a loafer on this list, especially considering its hold on the fashion girlies in recent seasons. The classic penny loafer has long been a favorite for business casual dress codes, but we love the added sophistication and cool of a chunky block heel and a sharp squared toe via this pair from Berlin-based label Aeyde. The brand is a favorite of Sali Christeson, founder and CEO of workwear label Argent, who notes its great selection of comfortable and work-friendly mid-height heels. The Anka features an extra-wide 2-inch heel for excellent support and comfort, making it a suitable option if your work day consists of standing for long periods or running around town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>IT35–IT42 | <strong>Heel height: </strong>2 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sandal-by-far-tanya-sandals></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sandal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>By Far Tanya Sandals</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="By Far Tanya Sandals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SU4YXTRhe3-RmlOVrDVM_ogkXE8=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/By-Far-Tanya-Sandals-414eaf64b20b4bb5a7ed26d0c63261e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>By Far</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The minimalist style is easy to dress up or down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It has no cushioning or arch support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re able to wear sandals to work, we suggest opting for a style that’s simplistic in design with a low- to mid-height heel — something cool and comfortable, and definitely not a flip-flop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our pick is the fan-favorite Tanya Sandals from cult shoe label By Far, which will quickly become the most versatile warm-weather shoe in your wardrobe. The simple style pairs a geometric block heel with two slim straps and a trendy squared toe for a barely-there shoe that looks good with just about anything, be it workwear, beachwear, or your favorite going-out top. In addition to a lineup of neutral hues, it’s also available in a few punchy colors that, given its minimalist design, pack just the right amount of punch for the office without going overboard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Size: </strong>EU35–EU41 | <strong>Heel height: </strong>6.7 centimeters</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boot-duoboots-dalia-standard-knee-high-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boot</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DuoBoots Dalia Standard Knee High Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DuoBoots Dalia Standard Knee High Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a3-LelPv-VknzevzuWJLAMxf88M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DuoBoots-Dalia-Standard-Knee-High-Boots-a3b8494dab264eaa978e398c4e384b93.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DuoBoots</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This boot is available in an inclusive range of calf widths and shaft heights.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Despite its calf-inclusivity, it doesn’t offer narrow or wide-foot options.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A simple knee-high boot can act as a comfortable alternative to a work heel, but shopping for a pair presents a unique struggle: Most boots, especially styles that are more fitted, are only offered in one calf width and typically don’t have enough stretch to accommodate an inclusive range of calf sizes. That’s what DuoBoots has set out to solve, offering its boots in eight different calf widths between 30 and 50 centimeters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the Dalia in particular for its sleek and minimalist design that includes an elasticated calf, memory foam insole, comfortable mid-heel, and the fact that it’s available in three different shaft heights: petite, standard, and tall.

Thankfully, plenty of shoe brands carry wide sizing to accommodate a variety of widths. Ally Shoes is one of the most innovative of the bunch, offering narrow, regular, wide, and extra-wide widths, making it a favorite of stylist Alison Bruhn. “It makes heels that are scientifically engineered to alleviate pain with a patented, ergonomic support structure,” she says. “The fact they’re available in four different widths is a huge plus, as that’s not very common.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Lower Block Heel is an excellent option for work thanks to its wide 2-inch heel, which hits that height sweet spot recommended by Dr. Tarr, and features the brand’s ergonomic insole and arch support.

To no surprise, this can result in a lot of aches and pains when an unsupportive shoe is worn, which is why it's recommended for folks with flat feet to look for shoes with ample arch support — like a pair from Sarah Flint. The Bruhn-recommended brand was founded on the principle that beautiful shoes can be actually comfortable, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pair provides the anatomical arch support that flat feet require in addition to 6 millimeters of footbed padding for an extra comfy feel.

We’re fans of these slingbacks from J.Crew, which are designed with a leg-lengthening elongated square toe and crafted from a croc-embossed silver leather that feels a tad more grown-up than a traditional smooth, high-shine finish. The kitten-height heel and adjustable slingback strap are ultra-comfy and provide great stability, making them an all-around great pick for a day at the office.

Minimalist in design save for its off-kilter egg-shaped heel, these mules will pair easily with just about any pair of trousers, skirt, or dress and are guaranteed to stand out. The almond-shaped toe provides a little more breathing room than a pointed one, and the V-shaped vamp is an especially flattering cut that provides slightly more coverage than the average pump. In short, the shoes are a conversation piece, and with a heel height under 2 inches, you can trust they won’t leave you in pain at the end of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>IT35–IT42 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>1.6 inches<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-animal-print-katy-perry-the-laterr-slingback-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Animal Print</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Katy Perry The Laterr Slingback Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Katy Perry The Laterr Slingback Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7Lskf5q_s6wZXgRWVuq09nOqDkg=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Katy-Perry-The-Laterr-Slingback-Pump-67f2b1eeff6c4aa7a09f0331290e5b8f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The flared heel helps better distribute weight and pressure across the foot for a more comfortable fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The metallic heel can scuff easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like metallics, animal print shoes have the power to imbue a dopamine-boosting playfulness into an otherwise understated work, and these Katy Perry slingbacks do just the trick. Trend-forward with a wallet-friendly price tag, they’re available in two different shades of snakeskin — mustard and a multi-colored red — both of which are subdued enough to pair seamlessly with just about anything. More importantly, they’re thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind, boasting a 2-inch spool heel and a cushioned footbed that makes these prime for wearing to the office, after-work drinks, and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic upper and lining; synthetic rubber sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel Height and Width</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Preferences on heel height will vary from person to person — more on that below — but as a general rule of thumb, you should stick to shopping for heel heights you already feel comfortable walking in, or lower. “If you’re wearing them to work, it’s definitely better for the heel to be lower rather than higher,” says Dr. Tarr. The width of a heel plays just as important a role in a shoe’s comfort level as the height — the wider, the better. “I prefer a heel that’s slightly more substantial so I can be on my feet at the office, in our stores, or on the subway comfortably for several hours at a time,” Christeson says. She previously recommended shoes from brands like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Gray Matters</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">AEYDE</a>, which offer great mid-height options with plenty of width.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Extra Support and Cushioning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The concept of only buying comfortable shoes may seem like a given, but more often than not, we shop with style in mind over everything else. “But if the shoes aren’t comfortable, you won’t wear them — they’ll sit in your closet and make you feel guilty,” warns Bruhn. That said, folks with flat feet, with high arches, or who are especially prone to soreness should seek out options with plenty of cushy and supportive features. Shoes specifically designed with style and comfort in mind — think similar features to orthopedic shoes like built-in arch support or memory foam insoles — are a good place to start, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sarah Flint Perfect Emma</a> or the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> Sanctuary All Night Mule</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Toe Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Toe shape is also important to consider — and, in some cases, the pointier the heel, the less comfortable the shoe might be. “Even though pointed toes look great, they’re not ideal for wearing all day long, as they can squish your toe, which leads to toe pain,” Dr. Tarr says. She recommends opting for something with a toe that’s more rounded than pointed — and lucky for us, square toes are still enjoying a moment in the spotlight. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Reformation’s Mallori Closed Toe Heel</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Calla’s Mary Jane</a> are great options for a true square toe, while the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Inez Frida</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">J.Crew Leona Slingback Heels</a> offer the perfect in-between.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Silhouette</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Comfort aside, the shape and silhouette of the shoe are also important to keep in mind, as different styles can complement different body types, explains Leitz. “For instance, block heels [like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Ally’s Lower Block Heel</a>] provide balance and stability for curvier body types, while stiletto heels [like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Larroudé’s Ines Pump</a>] can elongate the silhouette of a petite women,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best heel heights for work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What constitutes an ideal heel height for work will vary from person to person, says Bruhn. “Some people are comfortable in high heels and can wear them all day long, every day, while others need more support,” she says. That said, for those not a fan of high heels, Bruhn, Christeson, and Leitz suggest kitten heels — to be more specific, Dr. Tarr recommends a heel of 2 inches or less. “They’re the underdogs of the heel world, unassumingly elegant and subtly powerful without sacrificing comfort,” says Leitz. Just opt for a block heel and a shoe with a back, rather than an open mule, to be extra comfortable, adds Bruhn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This doesn’t necessarily mean higher heels should be off-limits, but you may want to find something with additional cushioning or support or add on your own gel insert to minimize any potential end-of-day soreness. It also goes without saying that while heels have long been associated with working women in the office, times have most definitely changed. “In the ever-evolving world of fashion, the notion that high heels equate to professionalism is as outdated as shoulder pads and perms,” says Leitz. That said, you can certainly still look polished and professional in flat shoes — just ask Christeson, who often pairs full suits with sneakers or loafers.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are some tips for preventing blisters and other foot problems when wearing heels to work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is anything worse than throwing on a pair of heels and running out the door, only to realize five minutes in that the back is rubbing your heel and causing a blister to form? (The answer is no.) While Bruhn recommends keeping bandages in your bag or desk drawer at all times just in case, her trick of the trade is using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">moleskin padding</a>. “It helps if you have one toe or one specific area of your foot that’s uncomfortable,” she says. “You can cut an individual square and put it over the tender area, which protects it from rubbing and pressure from the shoe.” If the balls of your feet get achy, she recommends applying a CBD cream or balm for some relief — a stylist trick for celebrities on the red carpet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, if your work day allows, you can always reduce the amount of time you’re wearing them. “Bring a pair of flats, sandals, or tennis shoes with you to work that you can either change into while sitting at your desk or wear during your commute,” says Tarr. “The less time you spend in the heels, the lower your risk of foot pain.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best ways to break in your work heels, if needed?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all love the look of a sparkly new pair of shoes, but they typically need some breaking in to be comfortable enough for all-day wear, especially with stiff leather. Leitz recommends doing it before you leave the house. “The first order of business is to put on the thickest, most comfortable socks in your drawer and slide into those new heels,” she says. “Take a stroll around your home, perhaps partake in a dance session to your favorite tunes, or even tackle the day’s tasks from the comfort of your home office, if you’re able to. This initial step will not only allow the shoes to comfortably stretch but also infuse a touch of high-fashion drama into your usual work-from-home routine.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For extra stubborn shoes, Leitz recommends the newspaper trick, which entails stuffing your shoes with damp newspaper overnight to gently stretch the leather to better accommodate the shape of your foot. “Damp, not soaking,” she says. “You wouldn't want to compromise the integrity of the shoe.” And if all else fails, she recommends leaving it to the professionals. “Shoemakers possess the necessary tools and expertise to widen shoes without inflicting damage," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Igneri</a> is a freelance writer who has been working in fashion and beauty media for over a decade.

Or are they separated and on different paths? Let us find out!</p><h2>Is Shaw Still Dating Her Actor Boyfriend Or Have They Parted Ways?</h2><p>The internet world knows that Shaw was once in a relationship with actor Ethan Peck. The couple began dating back in 2009, and the fans were absolutely in love with this pair.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Ethan%20Peck%20with%20Lindsay%20Shaw.jpg width=550 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Caption: Ethan Peck and Lindsey Shaw dated back in 2009.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the question which is on everyone's mind at the moment is "are the still dating one another?"</p><p>Well, the answer to that might be a NO as the two reportedly split up in the year 2010 with not many revelations about the reason behind the split up. Moreover, following the split with Shaw, <a href=# rel=follow>Ethan&nbsp;dated&nbsp;Julianna Guill, who he was first linked with back in 2012</a> but still, no advertising of the relationship has come forth.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>So now that we know Shaw and Ethan are not together and to add to that, Shaw has not been vocal about having a partner in her life at the moment. So,&nbsp;one might conclude that she is more concerned about earning more fame and name in her career rather than shift her focus to having a partner, getting married and settle&nbsp;down in her life.</p><p>Speaking of her career, she is most known for the portrayal of a lesbian character in the successful series "Pretty Little Liars" where she plays&nbsp;Paige who is madly in love with Emily played by Shay Mitchel.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>back in 2011, Lindsey discussed her role as Paige on the very series and elaborated how she landed the role. She shared, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When I got the audition for Paige, I had just cut my hair. I got back from my summer, and I was like, “I really just need to cut this off.” I actually cut 10 inches off my hair. I went in and read for the part and I think they liked me, but I kind of got the feeling they wanted a blonde for the role. But they called me back for a chemistry read with&nbsp;Shay Mitchell&nbsp;and it was amazing. Sometimes chemistry reads can be — I don’t know, just not as good as you want them to be. But it was so much fun with Shay. I remember saying to her afterward, “You’re&nbsp;really&nbsp;good!” But I didn’t mean it like that. I meant, “This is really fun!”</p><p>Shaw continued,</p><p>I got the part and I was so excited. When my manager called to tell me I’d gotten it, he was like, “But&nbsp;they want to do something even more drastic with your hair.” Hence the shorter ‘do and the bangs. Anyway, the three-episode arc turned into a six-episode arc, and it was like a fairy tale the whole way through. It was a like a cornucopia — yes, I just said cornucopia — of really wonderful experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;Moreover, on playing an on-screen lesbian, she divulged,</p><p>Playing a lesbian character is obviously relevant right now. There are so many equality issues and issues with gay teens being bullied, and I feel like the media has always been a leader in helping shape people’s attitudes. You know, it lends a little understanding. It makes people less fearful. And being given the opportunity to play a lesbian character, I really took it seriously.</p><p>I just wanted to be as emotionally truthful as I could, even if I’ve never experienced these things first hand. But, I mean, this wasn’t just another role for me. It was a big opportunity to speak to people and change their attitudes, and to speak kids who are maybe struggling with their sexuality and to say, “You’re wonderful. And you’re not alone.”</p><p>Great words there from the actress and the words are inspiring for those who still are sitting in the dark and not being able to accept who they are.</p><h2>Has She Undergone Some Weight Loss?</h2><p>Lindsey Shaw once revealed her photos from a shoot where she looked completely different than before. She also seemed to have shed some pounds, and that often makes people wonder if she has gone through some weight loss.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/Lindsey%20Shaw.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Caption: Lindsey Shaw does look to have shed some weight.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even her co-star Ryan Guzman took over his Twitter to acknowledge&nbsp;her beauty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, she has to come forth and accepted that she had done it, but regardless, she looks even more stunning than before!</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for latest updates on Lindsey Shaw!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZmark6eyprqMpZysmpmWu264yKebrJ2pYsCprdZmqq2hnKF6pa3ToqWgZZGYwbC%2BjJumsp6inrKvsIycpqeblae7prCMnJirnZWneqix062gp59doq6zvsiem2egpKK5</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nikki-perkins.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nikki Perkins Biography</a>

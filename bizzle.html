Therefore, his primary source of income is his music career. However, his <strong>net worth</strong> stands at around $2.5 million as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>When he was 13 years old, he first stepped into a music studio. And, listening to Tupac, he started to establish a talent for writing rhymes. But, this man noticed that his content mostly mimicked those he listened to, whether it was his uncle or other rappers. Further, topics like shooting or packing pistols.</p><p>Likewise, after graduating, he put out 5 mixtapes and started circulating them in malls, clubs, radio stations, and anywhere else he could. Eventually, this rapper got an opportunity to open up for Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana during their I Can’t Feel My Face tour. Also, he opened up for Lil Boosie. However, while trying to move his music, his financial situation got worse.</p><p>He also stated in an interview that his financial situation got so bad that he was sleeping on a friend’s floor and his car was a closet for his clothes.&nbsp;This man started selling drugs and even became a pimp to fund his music career and to maintain a certain image around those he aspired to become like in the industry.</p><p>Similarly, in January 2010, he released “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">You Got Some Explaining to Do</a>” directed toward Jay-Z. Therefore, he called the rap icon out on his negative references to Jesus and Christianity in his music. Therefore, the video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even he couldn’t anticipate. Moreover, he released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.</p><p>Similarly, in March 2010, he released his first mixtape ‘The Messenger’. Soon after the release, in Houston, Texas, he founded ‘God Over Money Records’. Therefore, since its creation, the label has released 8 mixtapes, a collaborative album with artist Willie ‘P-Dub’ Moore Jr., 3 full-length studio albums, and has signed 2 artists.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-157217 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bizzle-perf.jpg alt=Bizzle width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-157217 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Bizzle while performing.

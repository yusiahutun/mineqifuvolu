His father is Kevin James, an actor best known for his role on his sitcom, “The King of Queens,” as Doug Heffernan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kevin.jpg><p>The sitcom ran for several years, making him one of the few actors with a Primetime Emmy Award. Later on, Kevin began a career as a leading film actor, which led him to co-star in films like “Hitch” (2005), “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry” (2007), “Grown Ups” (2010), and “Grown Ups 2” (2013).</p><p>He also headlined “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (2009), “Zookeeper” (2011), “Here Comes the Boom” (2012), and “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” (2015). His wife’s name is Steffiana de la Cruz, and she is also an actress.&nbsp;</p><p>The August-born talent has been featured in <a href=#>movies</a> like “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (2009), “Zookeeper” (2011), and “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” (2015). Including Kannon, the pair have four kids they dote on.&nbsp;</p><p>Kannon is the <a href=#>third child</a> of Kevin James and his wife, Steffiana. He was born in April 2011 and has two older sisters, Sienna-Marie and Shea.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Steff.jpg><p>So far, Kannon is the only male child Kevin James, and his wife have. Since his birth, the couple welcomed one more female child, Sistine James.&nbsp;</p><p>Kannon and his sisters live sheltered lives, and their parents often keep them away from public scrutiny. Because of this, not much is known about their childhood or the milestones they have reached.&nbsp;</p><p>Kannon’s father takes pride in his work. He has confessed in the past that his family has also affected the kind of roles he takes on. He once <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;“They’re elements of myself in these characters.”</p><p>Perhaps this is why the proud father has never missed acting in family-oriented movies. For example, his role in “Kevin Can Wait” hit home because it was his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Kannon and his sisters are still too young to know how their lives will go, but Kevin once confessed that they enjoy “editing videos.” The doting father claimed they would most likely prefer being behind the camera than in front of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin is convinced they will be comedians if they do decide to go in front of the cameras. They seem to have a great sense of humor and are always willing to make jokes.&nbsp;In an interview, the actor said that he is breeding his children for comedy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Details About Kannon Valentine James’ Parents</h2><p>As stated earlier, Kannon’s parents are actors with some great movies to their credit. The couple has been happily married for over a decade, and from the looks of things, there will be decades more to enjoy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kevin-and-his-fam.jpg><p>Steffiana is most popularly known for her roles in her husband’s movies, including “Zookeeper” and the “Paul Blart” franchise. She is also known to have appeared several times in “King of Queens.”&nbsp;</p><p>Off the set, the couple keeps their life private. However, in the past, Kevin has revealed that his marriage to Steffiana and the family they’ve raised together have inspired his work.&nbsp;</p><p>The parents-of-four work hard as actors but never let it encroach on their family life. In 2015, Kevin revealed that his children travel everywhere with him.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, the couple <a href=#>celebrated</a> 13 years of marriage, and Kevin shared a romantic shot of his wife kissing him. The caption read: “My incredible wife… 13 years today!!! DEO GRATIAS!”</p><p>Kevin still sees Steffiana as the love of his life as they approach two decades together as a married couple. The lovebirds met each other on a blind date in 2001. They hit it off and, soon after, moved in together. By the fall of 2003, they were <a href=#>engaged</a>, and on June 19, 2004, they tied the knot at St. Edward Catholic Church in Dana Point, California.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuKK6zailZq6RobKvwMinnGaikaKytHnWmqpmmp%2Bnu27AzmarsKddqa6tsc2tnJ1lo6mus7%2BMppyerF2ptaa5jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./65816361268e3ec53b8b45a5-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pornhub revela cules son los videojuegos y personajes ms buscados en su pgina</a>

In an exclusive interview, the head of the Pentagon’s UFO office, Sean Kirkpatrick, revealed he will step down from his post in December. This announcement came months after a whistleblower claimed that the US government is hiding evidence of Aliens.</p><p>After nearly 18 months on the job, Kirkpatrick, the head of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), feels he has achieved his goals.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Kirkpatrick_Become_the_Pentagon_UFO_Boss></span><strong>When Did Kirkpatrick Become the Pentagon UFO Boss?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Biden administration established the Pentagon UFO office in July 2022. Under Kirkpatrick’s leadership, the office was to look into the unidentified craft military pilots have increasingly reported seeing in the skies. In addition, the office was to check whether these unidentified crafts threatened national security.</p><p>Since then, Kirkpatrick has investigated more than 800 cases. Although short, his tenure witnessed a high level of public interest in the issue of UFOs and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kirkpatrick_Made_Headlines_in_the_Summer></span><strong>Kirkpatrick Made Headlines in the Summer</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although his position gathered much media interest and attention from its inception, Kirkpatrick made headlines during the summer earlier this year. The Pentagon boss made rounds in the media when he fired back at a whistleblower’s explosive claim about a government cover-up.</p><p>“AARO has not uncovered any evidence to support the claim,” Kirkpatrick said. In addition, he called the claims “insulting.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_Whistleblower></span><strong>Who is the Whistleblower?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The whistleblower is a retired Air Force intelligence officer, Maj. David Grusch. He claimed that the government is covering up a decades-long program to reverse-engineer alien craft. In addition, Grusch alleged that the US government had evidence of ‘intact and partially intact’ alien vehicles.</p><p>As expected, Grusch’s allegations gained widespread attention and saw many speculating about the possibility of a government cover-up.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kirkpatrick_said_Grusch_Refused_Multiple_Interview_Requests></span><strong>Kirkpatrick said Grusch Refused Multiple Interview Requests&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following Grusch’s allegations against the US government, Kirkpatrick revealed that Grusch refused multiple interview requests with AARO. However, Grusch denied having gotten any interview requests from AARO.</p><p>Consequently, lawmakers, witnesses, and UFO enthusiasts have continued expressing their opinions. While some think Grusch’s claims are baseless, others criticize the government and think it is a “lack of transparency” from the government regarding the phenomenon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pentagon_UFO_Boss_Says_the_AARO_is_Transparent></span><strong>Pentagon UFO Boss Says the AARO is Transparent&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the public outrage and concerns, Kirkpatrick reiterated his office’s commitment to looking into Grusch’s claims and several others. In an interview, the Pentagon UFO boss said the AARO has made strides where transparency is concerned.</p><p>He added that these strides include launching a long-anticipated online tool for former and current service members and government employees to report UFO sightings in the country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Many_Think_Kirkpatrick_is_Honest></span><strong>Many Think Kirkpatrick is Honest</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While some public members think the Pentagon UFO boss is not transparent, others believe he is. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in a statement, “Dr. Kirkpatrick has served the American people with honesty and integrity, tackling an incredibly difficult mission to explain the unknown.”&nbsp;</p><p>He added that Kirkpatrick’s commitment to transparency with the American public will leave a lasting legacy in the department.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pentagon_UFO_Boss_Admitted_to_Gruschs_Claims></span><strong>Pentagon UFO Boss Admitted to Grusch’s Claims</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Kirkpatrick initially called Grusch’s claims “insulting,” the Pentagon UFO boss later admitted to the allegations. While speaking during an off-camera meeting with the press, the AARO director admitted some of the claims could be true.</p><p>“We are investigating each and every one of his (Grusch) claims,” he said. He also added that some bits of the claims are turning out to be things and events that happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kirkpatricks_Final_Task></span><strong>Kirkpatrick’s Final Task</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since talks of Kirkpatrick’s retirement plans hit the media, many have been curious about his report on the cover-up allegations. However, the AARO boss said, “A lot of it is still under review, and we’re putting all that together into our historical report.”</p><p>The historical report is reportedly one of the final tasks Kirkpatrick will complete before leaving the office next month.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Controversial_Draft_Paper></span><strong>His Controversial Draft Paper</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from his job as the AARO boss, Kirkpatrick co-authored a draft paper with Harvard “alien hunter” Professor Avi Loeb. However, Kirkpatrick’s draft paper leaked online. The draft paper suggested the UP studied by the AARO could be “alien probes” sent to investigate Earth.</p><p>While he did not permit the paper to be published, Dr Kirkpatrick said he did not regret his involvement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pentagon_UFO_Boss_Wants_to_Prove_Aliens_Exist></span><strong>Pentagon UFO Boss Wants to Prove Aliens Exist</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to what many believe, Kirkpatrick is not a gatekeeper of the government’s UFO secrets. The Pentagon UFO boss wants to prove that aliens exist more than anyone! In an interview, Kirkpatrick said, “The best thing that could come out of this job is to prove that there are aliens.”</p><p>He added, “If we don’t prove it’s aliens, then what we’re finding is evidence of other people doing stuff in our backyard. And that’s not good.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Kirkpatrick_Stepping_Down></span><strong>Why is Kirkpatrick Stepping Down?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many are curious since the Pentagon UFO boss revealed his plans to step down in December. However, Kirkpatrick announced that he postponed his retirement in 2022 to lead AARO, and now that he’s achieved his goals, it’s time to move on.</p><p>“I’m ready to move on. I have accomplished everything I said I was going to do,” Kirkpatrick said. However, he added that he still wants to finish a few tasks, including wrapping up the historical review of the unidentified anomalous phenomena issue, before leaving.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Gruschs_Claims_True></span><strong>Are Grusch’s Claims True?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no definite answer to whether Grusch’s allegations against the US government are true. However, his claims and Kirkpatrick’s admission have made many rethink their stance on the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Still, some believe the government is hiding information about its knowledge of what exists in the skies above. Nonetheless, time will tell whether Grusch’s claims are true or not.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kvaa605qeqKZdqrOwecGoqqxlpKR6tMDEqWSdp6ejeqKy056pZq%2BYnsC1uMSbo6ivlad6trLOZpqlmZmiwHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./reasons-behind-the-hype-house-meltdown-the-jack-wright-and-sienna-mae-situation.html>&#171;&nbsp;Reasons Behind the Hype House Meltdown: the Jack Wright and Sienna Mae Situation</a>

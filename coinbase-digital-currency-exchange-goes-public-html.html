seen with Indonesian actress Raline Shah at a gala in November 2018</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Born in San Jose, California, Armstrong attended Rice University in Houston, Texas, before joining IBM.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May 2011 he began working as a technical product manager at Airbnb - and conceived the idea that would make him a billionaire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He&nbsp;watched as Airbnb suddenly turned off listings from Cuba to comply with U.S. government policy, he told <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Time</a> magazine, for their 2019 'Time 100 Next' feature.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cuban hosts, renting their homes via the platform, lost a link to the global economy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He began to ponder whether there was a way for people to exchange goods and services with less government interference, and came up with the idea of Coinbase, which launched in 2012.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 2018, when he was 35, he had made his first billion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong’s leadership is not without controversy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the fall he triggered an exodus of more than 60 workers after putting in place a controversial policy limiting employees from discussing political and social issues during work hours.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong published a&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel=nofollow href=#>blog post</a>, declaring that Coinbase was a ‘mission focused company’ that should ‘have the biggest impact on the world’ by ‘playing as a championship team.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he added that while it ‘has become common for Silicon Valley companies to engage in a wide variety of social activism, even those unrelated to what the company does,’ Coinbase has ‘decided to take a different approach.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong wrote: ‘The reason is that while I think these efforts are well intentioned, they have the potential to destroy a lot of value at most companies, both by being a distraction, and by creating internal division.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We’ve seen what internal strife at companies like Google and Facebook can do to productivity, and there are many smaller companies who have had their own challenges here,' Armstrong writes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I believe most employees don’t want to work in these divisive environments.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They want to work on a winning team that is united and making progress toward an important mission.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They want to be respected at work, have a welcoming environment where they can contribute, and have growth opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They want the workplace to be a refuge from the division that is increasingly present in the world.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong added: 'We are an intense culture and we are an apolitical culture.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong's blog post was met with opposition from some employees, according to <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Verge</a>.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Most people disagree with the stance and don’t see a clear-cut separation of the company’s mission and societal issues,' one employee was quoted as saying.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Others may agree with the spirit of what Brian’s suggesting, knowing how he personally thinks about mainstream issues, but don’t agree with the tone or the approach.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the death of George Floyd last spring, Armstrong declined to issue a statement affirming that 'black lives matter.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In response, several of the firm's engineers staged a walkout, according to Twitter user Erica Joy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong then posted a thread on his Twitter account expressing support for Black Lives Matter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After Armstrong published his blog post in late September, it was reported that the company began offering 'exit packages' to those who felt uncomfortable with the firm's apolitical stance.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Employees with less than three years of tenure would receive four months severance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those who worked for the firm for more than three years would receive six months severance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition, departing employees would have their health coverage intact through COBRA for six months.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The terms of the severance were first reported by the news site <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel=nofollow href=#>The Block</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong is comparatively low key, recommending books on social media about investing and leadership, and tweeting about taking a day off to clear his thoughts and come up with new ideas.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Believed to be unmarried, he turned heads in 2018 by arriving at a gala dubbed 'The Oscars of Science' with glamorous Indonesian actress Raline Shah, 36.</p><img id=i-9f9b45f52b3b917a

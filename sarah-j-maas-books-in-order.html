Maas is the bestselling author of the Throne of Glass series, the A Court of Thorns and Roses series (also known as ACOTAR), and the Crescent City series. She has sold more than 38 million books published in 38 languages worldwide. While focusing on (mostly) separate storylines, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/throne-of-glass-series-order/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah J. Maas’ books</a> all have some common elements: At least some of the characters are Fae, a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1326422/lord-of-the-rings-order/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of the Rings</a> Elf-like race which plays a major role in all three series; the stories are set in completely fictional, immersive fantasy worlds; and the plots of rebellion, romance, and revenge are lead by headstrong heroines.</p><p>If this sounds amazing, one or all of these <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/best-books-2024/ rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy series</a> is perfect for you!

The first book introduces Feyre Archeron, a human huntress who kills a wolf she later discovers was a faerie. As a consequence, one of the powerful Fae comes to claim her, saying she must live out her days in the Spring Court of the Fae country Prythian. There, Feyre learns more about her captor Tamlin, one of seven Fae High Lords. She is also made aware of a villainous force that she may be the key to defeating.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>A Court of Mist and Fury (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/A-Court-of-Mist-and-Fury.jpg><p>Those unfamiliar with the author’s writing style are in for a shock with A Court of Mist and Fury, in which the focus of the entire series abruptly changes. In the second book, Feyre has PTSD from the events that took place at the end of the first ACOTAR book. She also has a bargain to honor with Rhysand, the mysterious High Lord of the Night Court. In the riveting second book, Feyre must make decisions about her future and who she wants to be—and who she wants to be with.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>A Court of Wings and Ruin (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/A-Court-of-Wings-and-Ruin.jpg><p>In A Court of Wings and Ruin, Feyre and her found family must rally as many allies as possible to defend Prythian from the biggest threat the country has faced in half a millennium. Feyre asserts to all that she will be a pawn no longer, and will do whatever it takes to protect her loved ones.</p><p>The first three ACOTAR books comprise their complete own story, making the end of A Court of Wings and Ruin the perfect time to pause and switch to another series if you are reading all the Sarah J. Maas books in order. Reading these ACOTAR books first also means that you will be able to appreciate the small references to them that appear in the author’s debut series, Throne of Glass.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>The Assassin’s Blade (2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Assassins-Blade.jpg><p>The Assassin’s Blade comprises a series of short stories which take place before the first book in the young adult Throne of Glass series. There is some debate over when to read the prequel, but reading it first works as an introduction to the setting and the series’ protagonist through some of her past adventures.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Throne of Glass (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Throne-of-Glass.jpg><p>But if you are reading Throne of Glass first, it will be your first encounter with the continent of Erilea, a place where magic has vanished and an evil empire has conquered most of the land. The renowned assassin Celaena Sardothien is offered a chance at freedom when Prince Dorian invites her to compete to become the King’s Champion. All she has to do is beat out 23 other dangerous competitors. The first book introduces three main characters—Celaena, Dorian, and Chaol—as well as Princess Nehemia, an important supporting character.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Crown of Midnight (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Crown-of-Midnight.jpg><p>In Crown of Midnight, Celaena grapples with the ramifications of the choices she made in the first book, while her relationships with her closest friends change. This book continues the exploits of Celaena, Dorian, and Chaol, as they consider what their next steps will be. Until one night, tragedy strikes, and the main trio is left reeling.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Heir of Fire (2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Heir-of-Fire.jpg><p>Celaena is on a new mission which takes her to the eastward continent, where magic is still alive, and the mighty Fae royalty rules. Meanwhile, Dorian and Chaol navigate a new round of politics back home. In Heir of Fire, the series’ overall story begins to take shape. Important players in the oncoming conflict are also introduced: the domineering Fae Prince Rowan, the renowned general Prince Aedion, and the ferocious witch Manon Blackbeak.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Queen of Shadows (2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Queen-of-Shadows.jpg><p>After a cold homecoming, our heroine and her allies begin a new era, participating in an underground rebellion against the empire that has laid waste to Erilea. Additional fan-favorite characters make their first appearances, including Lysandra, Elide, and Nesryn.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Empire of Storms (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Empire-of-Storms.jpg><p>While Chaol and Nesryn travel to the Southern Continent to request military aid, the rest of the cast searches for allies and answers of how to defeat a nearly invulnerable enemy—and uncover a devastating secret. Readers will be heartbroken after closing this book, but it is all important as the Throne of Glass series nears its end.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>&nbsp;Tower of Dawn (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tower-of-Dawn.jpg><p>Taking place at the same time as Empire of Storms, Tower of Dawn follows Chaol and Nesryn on their diplomatic mission to a new city in a new land. There they meet the healer Yrene, the last addition to the power squad. The heroes find out more about the threat they face, and discover the thing that may be their salvation.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Kingdom of Ash (2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Kingdom-of-Ash.jpg><p>All characters return to Erilea for the final battle that will determine the future of their kingdoms and their world. Sacrifices are made, thrones are reclaimed, friends and lovers reunite—and some familiar faces make a surprise appearance. After the finale, it is time to return to the parallel world of ACOTAR.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>&nbsp;A Court of Frost and Starlight (2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/A-Court-of-Frost-and-Starlight.jpg><p>After the intense conclusion to the Throne of Glass series, A Court of Frost and Starlight is perfect as the next stop while reading the Sarah J. Maas books in order. This novella will reintroduce you to Feyre and co. during their holiday season. The entire book is frosty settings, exchanging gifts, and the characters helping their community heal after a devastating war.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>A Court of Silver Flames (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/A-Court-of-Silver-Flames.jpg><p>A Court of Silver Flames is the first strictly adult novel in the ACOTAR series and focuses on the captivating story of Feyre’s fiery eldest sister Nesta. If you loved Throne of Glass, you will chuckle when you hear about the small crossover moment from the perspective of these characters. While Feyre’s story is at an end, a new overall plot begins. It is expected that future ACOTAR books will each focus on a different character or couple. However, these books are yet to come, which means it is time to begin reading the author’s first entirely adult series.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>House of Earth and Blood (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/House-of-Earth-and-Blood.jpg><p>The first book in the Crescent City series introduces a vibrant new modern fantasy world. Fae, humans, wolf shifters, witches, mermaids, adorable messenger otters, and more populate the glittering city of Lunathion. The story follows a half-Fae, half-human Lunathion resident Bryce Quinlan, who is grieving her closest friends. When new information about their murders comes to light two years later, Bryce finds herself paired with the fallen angel Hunt Athalar to uncover the truth.<br>House of Earth and Blood serves as an introduction to a new world—with its own magical beings and lore—and the injustices of its society that will grow into a bigger story. However, the first Crescent City book is most of all a heartrending story about friendship which stands out among the many romances that came before in the Sarah J. Maas books in order.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>House of Sky and Breath (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/House-of-Sky-and-Breath.jpg><p>After the events of the first book, Bryce and Hunt are trying to live a normal life with less life-threatening adventures, but are pulled into the brewing rebellion against the tyrannical rule of the Asteri. Bryce and Hunt, with help from Bryce’s brother Ruhn and several other popular characters, discover secrets that shake the foundations of the multiverse they live in, leading up to a thrilling finale.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>House of Flame and Shadow (2024)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/House-of-Flame-and-Shadow.jpg><p>After an unprecedented cliffhanger at the end of House of Sky and Breath, Bryce and Hunt are worlds apart, with no idea how to get back to each other and continue their fight against the Asteri. House of Flame and Shadow introduces more connections between the three series than ever before, suggesting that in the future, reading all the Sarah J. Maas books in order will be a lot more complicated.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqK6zrcdmoWalkZbAbq7OqKKsZZmjerC%2Bw56paA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./juicy-couture-meets-haute-couture-fashion-rebel-vetements.html>&#171;&nbsp;Juicy Couture meets haute couture as fashion rebel Vetements shakes up Paris</a>

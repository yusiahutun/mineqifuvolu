While the length may be right in one suit, the waist may not, and while another might get the bust right, the crotch length might feel a little too short. Getting the right jumpsuit as a plus-sized buyer is all about trial and error, and being willing to kiss a few fashion frogs before really finding your jumpsuit prince.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In service of that quest, we put together a list of 16 of our favorite plus-size jumpsuits with the help of fashion experts.

The Los Angeles-based manufacturer and retailer has made a name for itself by churning out well-made and stylish unisex basics from polos to pants, but the company’s jumpsuit line is where it really shines. With about 30 colors and prints in production, the company has something for everyone. It sells suits with short sleeves and suits with long sleeves, and if you’re petite, you can get a suit cut specially for you. Big Bud’s jumpsuits are durable, becoming increasingly comfortable with each wash. They’re a solid investment, too, with the suits holding their value pretty well on the resale market, even after a good deal of wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we have one caveat about Big Bud’s jumpsuits, it's that the brand’s unisex sizing can be a bit confusing, especially for first-time customers. While Nooworks founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jennifer D’Angelo</a> says she’s a fan of actually going to a Big Bud store to try a few suits on if you can swing it, if you’re not in a market that has an outlet, be sure to take your measurements and consult the size chart. Don’t be afraid to seek alterations, either: Get something that fits you around the middle, even if you have to lop a few inches off the legs after purchase. It’s a quick and easy alteration that you can get done at pretty much any dry cleaner, and it’ll make all the difference in terms of you feeling your best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton twill | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–6XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-affordable-cider-v-neck-ruched-wide-leg-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Affordable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cider V-Neck Ruched Wide Leg Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cider V-Neck Ruched Wide Leg Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zBw0tUVIRYyYasEdHxRpiNnEU64=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cider--v-neck-ruched-wide-leg-jumpsuit-11062ad2240f46e887565bdfac2d0614.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cider&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s cute and it’s affordable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some buyers say the waistband can feel a bit tight, and note the zipper is hard to do by yourself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A quick and easy jumpsuit with a reasonable amount of stretch, Cider’s V-Neck velvet jumpsuit is the perfect piece to wear to dinner, to a party, or even to work. With a high waist and wide legs, it’s universally flattering, and the V-neck frames the face quite nicely. The back zipper gives the suit a slightly more formal fit compared to something that’s entirely elastic, and the suit’s rich green color is lush and semi-reflective. Best of all, this jumpsuit is just $32, making it a certified steal. What’s not to love about something cute, flattering, and a great bargain?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>12–26</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-fashion-brand-jumpsuit-of-the-future></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fashion Brand Jumpsuit Of The Future</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fashion Brand Jumpsuit Of The Future" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aIeF4uzxxj2aUtJxip5BjmpE9_w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jumpsuit-of-the-future-french-blue-de859f6c7a214f979846c47c8802bca9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fashion Brand&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Both the suit and the brand are delightfully quirky.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Despite it's convertibility, it’s not the absolute most versatile piece, but sometimes that doesn’t matter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another Los Angeles-based studio, Fashion Brand makes clothes (it says) with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">lizards</a> in mind.

It’s machine-washable, which is great, but it’s also a conversation starter. Everyone will want to know where you got your wild jumpsuit, and you’ll be able to show them all its neat little tricks and quirks — worthwhile reasons for the $200 indulgence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Linen<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS/XS–3X/4X</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-dokotoo-loose-sleeveless-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dokotoo Loose Sleeveless Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dokotoo Loose Sleeveless Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6AbFQwaCUkkxQfqi5EZl2vNLM-8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dokotoo--loose-sleeveless-jumpsuit--8bbeb41f0dfa4d64b8a65ebce7829f4e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This easy-to-wear jumpsuit is perfect for lazy days at home.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sometimes garments labeled “plus-size” on Amazon are anything but.

You can wear them over a bathing suit to the beach, over a T-shirt for school pick-up and drop-off, or with just about anything for a run to the store. They’re categorically easy, and they’re increasingly popular specifically for that reason: People love how versatile they are, and they love that you can just jump into them and waltz out the door.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dokotoo’s entry in the loose, sleeveless jumpsuit market comes in more than 35 colors and fits sizes up to 4X. (If you want something baggy, you might want to size up, since these Amazon “plus size” options are sometimes anything but.)

The charmingly basic suit comes in black or dark green and has all the hallmarks of a traditional coverall, from ample pockets to a smart collar and set of cuffed sleeves. This isn’t your dad’s old set of Dickie’s, though: It has a slightly more tailored shape, with a structured waist and a tapered leg. A nice placket hides hidden buttons, and the garment is made of 25 percent recycled cotton that’s been colored with low-impact Oeko-Tex dyes, so you can feel pretty solid about your impact on the environment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled cotton | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–4XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shorts-milumia-plus-size-corduroy-romper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milumia Plus Size Corduroy Romper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milumia Plus Size Corduroy Romper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1on_HAEp_4SlM4QanF1VFF9czuc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/milumia--plus-size-corduroy-romper-a523585eb8094d5da7b5d1089bb58ad6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Shortalls are incredibly versatile.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s hand wash-only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something so cute about a short little pair of overalls.

(FYI: Those same buyers also recommend sizing up if you’re looking for a more flowy look, so plan accordingly.)&nbsp;Pair them with tights and a spangly long sleeve for a holiday party, or a tank top and work boots for a Sunday afternoon hike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>L–5XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-formal-eloquii-suit-styled-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Formal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eloquii Suit-Styled Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eloquii Suit-Styled Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GfWUkqTjBWtwSKbrBmEsQAxGaaw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eloquii--suit-styled-jumpsuit-bf88b11781b3472a8f131698290a8ec1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eloquii&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This extremely versatile jumpsuit can be dressed up or down for any occasion.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Back pockets are non-functional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A favorite of influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Tinsaye Berhanu</a>, this Eloquii jumpsuit has cool, suit-inspired details like a notch lapel and faux buttons, something Berhanu says makes it “feel like something you could wear to the office or on the red carpet.” The black color is super versatile, and the high-rise fit is flattering on all types of body shapes.

Constructed of breathable and durable organic cotton twill, the Libra is built to last, with Known Supply customers calling it “comfy” and “easy,” while hailing its overall versatility.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton twill<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–4XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-printed-nooworks-garden-suit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Printed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nooworks Garden Suit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nooworks Garden Suit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1BUrzxFbh_Vvl6S79PWV4cu4iu8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nooworks--garden-suit-b695a08d8bd5438ba82f03cb4b110f3a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nooworks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brand’s patterns are fun, bold, and can start a conversation.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Once a pattern is sold out, it’s gone forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a woman-run, woman-owned business, Nooworks seems to have special insight into what its customers want. The line of brightly colored and patterned garments are all well-constructed and built for a range of real women’s bodies, and once you find the cut that works for you — like this one-piece garden suit, for instance — you can just keep buying the same cut in different patterns, knowing you’ll like the result.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of the garden suit: Built from 100 percent linen, the oversized romper feels easy and breezy, slipping right on over your legs and zipping up the back. You can wear it with nothing underneath when it’s hot, or throw on a shirt and some boots underneath if you need a little extra warmth. There’s a pattern on Nooworks’ site for everyone, but if you’re not feeling what’s available today, just wait a few weeks: The brand releases new styles and colors multiple times every year. (And if you’re afraid of color, D’Angelo has a tip: “You can wear black if black is how you feel but you will feel so much happier in a wild print.

Adjustable straps give the wearer some level of customization, and the garment has subtle waistband detail as well as functional pockets, should you need a place to throw your phone. Add a pair of black pumps, some cat eye sunnies, and a red lip, and all you’ll need is a ‘57 Chevy convertible to complete the look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, and spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>10–30</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jersey-adrianna-papell-pintuck-wide-leg-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jersey</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Adrianna Papell Pintuck Wide Leg Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Adrianna Papell Pintuck Wide Leg Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KhVaXwPK9vCicp4asUdgZBjBhEc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/adrianna-papell--pintuck-wide-leg-jumpsuit--a245ce2fe9e74c0395075ca89243e356.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s basic, but it’s elegant.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Given that it’s entirely black, it’s a little hard to see all the detailing in photos online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A swishy little playsuit that’s equal parts casual and chic, Adrianna Papell’s pintuck jumpsuit is versatility exemplified.

If you’re apple-shaped, for instance, you might want something with a little more give in the middle and a wider leg to balance out your proportions. If you’re tall and athletic, then you might want something with longer legs and a leaner cut. Don’t be afraid to try on a few garments, cuts, and styles when in the market for a good jumpsuit, and don’t let one or two bad fits cause you to write off jumpsuits altogether. There’s something out there for you, we promise. You just have to keep looking.</li><li><strong>Style Preference: </strong>When it comes to shopping, Raygoza suggests thinking outside the box. “The key to getting over the fear of how a jumpsuit makes you look is to avoid thinking of what other people may think and focus on how you feel in the jumpsuit instead,” she explains. “Keep an eye out for options that will enhance your confidence when shopping, whether that means staying in your comfort zone or stepping out of it. Whether it’s a certain fabric, silhouette, or sleeve that you like wearing or have been wanting to try out, go for it! If you feel good in it, you look good in it.”</li><li><strong>Timelessness: </strong>At the very least, you can take solace in the fact that, once you find the perfect jumpsuit, you’ll be able to call on it for years to come. “I have a blue jumpsuit from Lane Bryant that’s a few years old but the color, cut, and length makes me feel invincible,” says Berhanu. “If I’m meeting new people or have a big social event I will almost always grab it for a little confidence boost.”</li><li><strong>Comfort: </strong>The worst part of finding the perfect jumpsuit is discovering that — oops! — it's difficult to get out of it. Too many jumpsuits are easy to hop into but can cause bathroom stall contortions if you have to zip yourself out solo.&nbsp;That’s why, when buying a jumpsuit, you should think not only about how it looks but also how it feels. Can you sit down in it without it riding up in your crotch? Is it as easy to get off as it is to get on? Does it have a little stretch for when you’re going up and down stairs, getting in and out of a car, or bending down to pick up your kid? That kind of range is something you have to be more conscious of with one-piece garments since, unlike matching sets, there isn’t always much room for adjustment.&nbsp;D’Angelo says to look for a jumpsuit that’s made of durable fabric, but that’s also comfortable and wearable. “Avoid any fabric that’s too soft,” she advises,” saying, “that usually has some plastic in it and will pill and stretch out.” She also suggests looking for YKK zippers and coverstitching, which she says are signs of quality construction.</li><li><strong>Styling: </strong>You might also want to consider the length of a jumpsuit if you’re planning on wearing it for multiple events. A jumpsuit that might look great with a pair of Keds, for instance, might look a bit too short when paired with a sky-high wedge. “Some jumpsuits just work better with heels,” Berhanu says, explaining that&nbsp;if she’s looking to pair a garment with a pump, she’ll look for something with a little more fabric. If she wants to wear flats or sneakers, then a tapered leg or shorter cut works best for her.</li><li><strong>Versatility: </strong>While you can make the case for an amazing singular jumpsuit that stands on its own merits (think Elvis’ Vegas looks, for instance), if you’re shopping with maximum bang for your buck in mind, you might want to pick up a jumpsuit that can meet a myriad of needs. “I love jumpsuits for their practicality, especially for plus-sized customers,” says Raygoza. “They're not just an easy, throw-on-and-go option, but they also bring endless style without the hassle of piecing together an outfit. Jumpsuits effortlessly celebrate curves and provide a comfortable solution for those moments when you want to look stylish with minimal effort.”</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-cf79342f-24bc-4eb1-b42d-349f945207c4></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is there a type of jumpsuit that looks better on plus-sized consumers?</span></p><p>There’s no one hard and fast rule when it comes to what jumpsuits work on all people. That being said, if you find that, as a plus-sized person, you’re typically into more structured fits, look for a jumpsuit made out of a stiffer fabric, like a twill or denim. Those fabrics tend to skim over curves, giving you a cool, utilitarian look. If, on the other hand, you’re into a more flowy, ethereal look in your clothes — and if you like to hide your shape behind more fabric — then consider a wide-leg jumpsuit, since the fabric’s flow will give you a longer, leaner silhouette. A tied or cinched waist is also a good option for those people since it’ll give you the appearance of a waist even if the rest of you is swathed in voluminous fabric.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Marah Eakin</a>, the author of this article, has been a journalist reporting on entertainment, fashion, and culture for almost 15 years.

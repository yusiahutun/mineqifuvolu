There are a few variants of the makeup product that the brand offers — powder, stick, liquid, and combos. If you have oily skin, powder blushes are the best option for you. On the other hand, for dry skin beauties, liquid or stick blushes can be a game changer for having moisturizing properties. Bronzer and blush combos are best for people who like to keep things casual while getting the job done.</p><p><strong>b) Tone- </strong>The color you're choosing should complement your own skin tone. For fair people, blushes with soft rosy, coral, or peachy hues work best. People who have medium skin tone, deep coral, mauve, and rose pink suit the most. Lastly, people with deeper skin tone can anyday flaunt tangerine, deep pink, and red bravely.</p><p><strong>c) Pigmentation- </strong>Make sure the blush you're picking has mild pigmentation so that you require a very little product. On the other hand, dealing with such a heavily pigmented blush can be quite tricky sometimes as you have lesser control over the product.</p><p><strong>d) Lasting Power- </strong>Your blush should last throughout the day to ensure unwavering glam. Powder blush often tends to fade faster than the creamy ones. However, you can pair both liquid or powder blush for better longevity.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>NARS blushes have the reputation of being one of the best ones available in the market. And thus, through our practical knowledge, we have curated these best NARS blushes that are power packed with essential potent ingredients and features to make them your ultimate holy grail. In short, they come in a cutesy packaging which further makes them a great travel companion, and the seamless texture definitely fetches extra brownie points, to say the least.

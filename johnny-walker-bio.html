But, sadly, despite scouring the whole internet, the details concerning Jhonny’s parents remain a mystery.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Henderson Bio: Career, Achievements, Net Worth, Record, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Contrarily, we know that Jhonny grew up in an impoverished family with only the necessities. Added to that, the neighborhood that they lived in was not that great either.</p><p>Thus, to prevent himself from getting involved in criminal activities, young Walker decided to take up MMA as a distraction source.</p><h2>Johnny Walker: Career</h2><p>After coming through the amateur ranks in Brazil, Walker made his professional MMA debut at Circuito Invictus de MMA 2 on December 14, 2013.</p><p>Having entered the fight with a reputation for knocking out opponents easily, Jhonny was a considerable favorite to win the contest.</p><p>Subsequently, staying true to all the expectations, the Brazilian fighter won the bout via TKO in the 49th second of the first round. Hence, Walker announced himself into the professional MMA scene with a bang.</p><p>Thereafter, the 26-year-old fought with <strong>Vitor Casanova</strong> and <strong>Joao Silva</strong>, with the outcome being the same as his debut match, first-round TKOs. Consequently, a lot of hype was growing up for the talented striker.</p><p>However, Walker was brought back down to Earth in his fourth professional fight as he lost to <strong>Wagner Prado</strong>. To explain, Prado TKO’d the Rio de Janeiro native in the 3-minute 40-second mark of the second round to seal an upset.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa Grasso Bio: Career, Age, Height, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Nevertheless, being the lion-hearted fighter Jhonny is, he picked himself up and won his next four bouts, all via finishes.</p><p>For instance, the 27-year-old won against <strong>Andrew Smith, Ricardo Pandora</strong>, and <strong>Murilo Grittz</strong> via TKOs while he submitted <strong>Marck Polimeno</strong> via a rear-naked choke.</p><p>Consequently, Walker earned the first title fight of his professional career against <strong>Klidson Abreu</strong> for the vacant Samurai FC Heavyweight Championship. But, sadly, the Rio de Janeiro native lost the fight due to a rear-naked choke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walker-945.jpg><p>Even though it was only the second loss of Jhonny’s young career, contrarily, he felt like one of the most significant opportunities of his life slipped out of his hands.</p><p>Consequently, in his next two fights, Walker seemed to lack a bit of confidence as he lost one and won the other.</p><p>Nevertheless, the talented 6 feet 6 striker dusted himself and went on a nine-fight win streak from March 25, 2017, to November 2, 2019. Likewise, in those nine fights, Jhonny had some memorable moments that eventually saw him land a prestigious UFC contract.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Henderson Bio: Career, Achievements, Net Worth, Record, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>For example, the 27-year-old won his first championship when he defeated <strong>Stuart Austin</strong> via KO to win the UCMMA Light Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>After that, Walker won the EBD Light Heavyweight Championship on March 12, 2018, by beating <strong>Cheick Kone</strong>.</p><p>Consequently, <strong>Dana White</strong>, the UFC president, invited the Brazilian light heavyweight to participate in Dana White’s Contender Series Brazil 2 tournament.</p><p>Subsequently, Jhonny won the fight through a unanimous decision against fellow Brazilian <strong>Henrique da Silva</strong> on August 11, 2018.</p><p>As a result, the Rio de Janeiro native earned himself a lucrative UFC contract that has seen him fight five times with the organization to date. To emphasize, Walker started with a bang as he won his first three fights via stoppages.</p><p>Additionally, Jhonny finished all three of those bouts in the first round, which cemented his spot as a dangerous fighter with a devastating knock-out ability.</p><p>Thereafter, the 27-year-old fought current no.6 ranked UFC light heavyweight <strong>Corey Anderson</strong> in the toughest fight of his career.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carla Esparza Bio: Career, Records, Height, Net Worth, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>But, this time, though, no Hollywood was ending as he lost the match in the very first round via TKO.</p><p>Subsequently, Walker faced <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nikita Krylov</strong> </a>in his most recent bout on March 14, 2020. Furthermore, going into the fight, the Rio de Janeiro native was a heavy favorite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walker-946.jpg><p>On the contrary, Krylov dominated the 15-minute contest and won through a unanimous decision. Nevertheless, judging by Jhonny’s past, we have no doubts that the 27-year-old light heavyweight will bounce back.</p><p>As a matter of fact, who knows, Walker might become a UFC champion in the future. And looking at his age, the 6 feet 6 giant still has another decade left in his young body.</p><h2>Johnny Walker: Age, Height & Record</h2><p>Jhonny was born in the year 1992, which makes him 27 years old currently. Furthermore, the light heavyweight contender started fighting professionally at the age of 20, which is extremely young for an MMA fighter.</p><p>Moving on, Walker stands at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), which makes him one of the taller fighters in the organization.</p><p>Additionally, the Rio de Janeiro native weighs 205 lb (93 kg), which is the maximum weight limit for a UFC light heavyweight fighter.</p><p>Talking about his record, the 27-year-old has a respectable record of 17 wins and five losses. Likewise, 14 of those 17 wins came via knockouts, while two came through submissions, making him a very dangerous fighter.</p><p>However, two of Jhonny’s five losses have been with the UFC, as he lost his most recent bouts with Krylov and Anderson consecutively.</p><p>Nonetheless, judging by the talent and punching power of UFC’s light heavyweight fighter, we have no doubts that he will improve his record in the future.</p><h2>Johnny Walker: Net Worth & Fight Purse</h2><p>As of 2020, Jhonny has a net worth of <strong>$500,000</strong> accrued mainly through his MMA activities and sponsorships. Although his net worth might seem a bit on the low side for a UFC fighter, contrarily, the 27-year-old has been involved in professional MMA for only seven years.</p><p>Added to that, it has not even been two years since Walker joined UFC. Therefore, we believe that, over time, this 6 feet 6 Brazilian light heavyweight will earn a lot more as he gathers up more fights under the UFC banner.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stipe Miocic Bio: Career, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Moreover, Jhonny bagged himself <strong>$57,000</strong> for his most recent fight with <a href=# rel=noopener>Nikita Krylov</a> on March 14, 2020. But unfortunately, the 27-year-old lost the bout. However, had he won the bout, Walker would have bagged himself another <strong>$47,000</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, in his five fights with UFC, Walker has already earned <strong>$345,000</strong>. Not only does this mean that the Rio de Janeiro native is making huge sums, but it also indicates his worth to the UFC.</p><h2>Johnny Walker: Girlfriend & Lifestyle</h2><p>Talking about his girlfriend, Jhonny seems to be in a relationship with Dayane de Souza Sardinha. Similarly, the rumors about the couple surfaced back in 2016 when he was still fighting in Brazil.</p><p>To be precise, Walker posted an Instagram picture regarding the matter, to which Dayane replied, “How beautiful, my love. I love you“.</p><p>Contrarily, there has been no further information regarding the topic from both sides.</p><p>Furthermore, the 27-year-old likes to spend most of his time in the gym, practicing and developing his skills. Nonetheless, whenever Jhonny does have free time, he likes to spend it with his fellow Brazilian friends in the U.S.</p><p>Moreover, the Rio de Janeiro native has one of the most eccentric hairstyles for a fighter. Maybe his long colorful mohawk acts as a distraction for his opponents, as suggested by his record of 17 wins and five losses.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Instagram (<a href=#>@johnnywalker</a>): 500k followers<br>Facebook (<a href=#>Johnny Walker</a>): 177k followers</p><h2>Johnny Walker: FAQs</h2><h3>What are Johnny Walker’s career statistics to date?</h3><p>Currently, Johnny Walker has played a total of 23 games, among which he has eighteen wins and five losses.

Some popular approaches to intermittent fasting include:</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alternate-day fasting. Eat a normal diet one day and either completely fast or have one small meal (less than 500 calories) the next day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>5:2 fasting. Eat a normal diet five days a week and fast two days a week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Daily time-restricted fasting. Eat normally but only within an eight-hour window each day. For example, skip breakfast but eat lunch around noon and dinner by 8 p.m.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some studies suggest that alternate-day fasting is about as effective as a typical low-calorie diet for weight loss. That seems reasonable because reducing the number of calories you eat should help you lose weight.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Can intermittent fasting improve your health? Losing weight and being physically active help lower your risk of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes, sleep apnea and some types of cancer. For these diseases, intermittent fasting seems to be about as beneficial as any other type of diet that reduces overall calories.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Information courtesy the <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mayo Clinic&nbsp;</a></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhqa2BtgnN9jnupqKebmnqDwdGknGZtYWKzra3Up6usZZaWr7a4zq6qZp6ZnMKzsYyoqZqml5p6tMDRoqWgZZKeuKq6yGaEmqSZl8JvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./food-network-star-molly-yehs-husband-meet-nick-hagen.html>&#171;&nbsp;Food Network Star Molly Yehs Husband: Meet Nick Hagen</a>

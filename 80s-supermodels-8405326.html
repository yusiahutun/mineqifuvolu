Discovered in a nightclub in 1976, she quickly shot to prominence, gracing campaigns and runways of iconic fashion houses. Photographers, including legends like Richard Avedon and Arthur Elgort, were captivated by her unique look. While her beauty was widely celebrated, Gia's personal life was tumultuous. She grappled with drug addiction and, later, the effects of HIV/AIDS. Tragically, her life was cut short when she succumbed to AIDS in 1986 at the age of 26. Beyond her modeling achievements, Gia holds a distinct place in the industry as one of the first openly LGBTQ+ models, breaking barriers in an era where such openness was rare.

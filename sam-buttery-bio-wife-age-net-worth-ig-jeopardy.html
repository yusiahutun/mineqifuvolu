The game show was created by Merv Griffin which features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with&nbsp;general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions.</p><p>Jeopardy fans also had to double-take during the episode from 13 December 2021. Fans believed Sam Buttery, now winner bore a striking resemblance to comedian Steve Martin. He became the first contestant to qualify for the Professor Tournament final after a highly competitive game.</p><p>One viewer wrote on Twitter, “Congrats to @SteveMartinToGo on making the finals of the @Jeopardy professors’ tournament.” Similarly, another wrote, “Interesting new role for @SteveMartinToGo as a college professor and @Jeopardy tournament semifinalist ‘Sam,”</p><p>Finally, all the tweets caught the attention of a comedian and he wrote, “I am relieved to find out this is not me. I was starting to doubt my sanity.”</p><p>Sam was one of the 15 professors competing for a prize of $100 thousand. With Sam taking home $100,000 professor Ed Hashima took second place and pocketed $50,000 whereas the third place went to Alsa Hove for $25,000.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Sam Buttery?</strong></h3><p>As of December 2021, Sam Buttery should be at least 64 years old.</p><h3><strong>Sam Buttery Wife</strong></h3><p>Sam Buttery is married to his wife Marie Elinda Hardy. He and his wife have been friends of the game show for years. Both he and his wife tried to get in on the show as contestants on several occasions. Because Sam is more of a science guy, his wife helped him to train with ballet, arts, and opera.</p><p>When Sam got the call from the show, he was on a vacation in Puerto Vallarta with his wife. They had both applied to the show and it was a moment of disbelief.</p><p>Talking about his wife, Marie is a graduate of San Jose State University. She graduated in 1991 with a degree in Legal Assistant Certificate.</p><p>Marie attended this 2-year program as well as Monterey Peninsula College where she earned 60 credits to apply for entrance to the Legal Studies Program. She has been working as a paralegal for Heisinger, Buck & Morris since 2003. Before that, she worked for Hawley & Llewellyn’s as Trusts and Estates Paralegal (2003). She also worked for the Northern California Cements Masons as an Administrative Assistant (20002-2003). In Law Offices of George W Walker (2001-2002) and Law Offices of Dennis W. Fox as Trust and Estates Paralegal.</p><p>You can find her on Facebook here (<a href=#>@elindah1</a>). Sam and Marie are <a href=#>members</a> of Pacific Grove Public Library. They appear to share at least two kids.</p><h3><strong>Sam Buttery Net Worth</strong></h3><p>With his latest wins, Sam Buttery has added at least $50 thousand in his current net worth of over $500 thousand.</p><p>Sam attended the University of California, Berkeley, and earned his PH.D. in 1996. He attended Princeton University and earned his degree in A.B. degree in Statistics in 1983.</p><p>Also, Sam completed his high school education at Phillips Exeter Academy. He has been serving as Naval Postgraduate School’s associate professor since 1996. He worked as Computer Systems Analyst for Cowen & Company for eight years from 1983-1991.</p><p>His teaching and research area includes Classification, General Applied Statistics, and Computer-Intensive Methods in Statistics.</p><p>During his callback, Sam let it slip that he was a professor at NPS. Not long after, he received an invitation to be one of 15 professors featured in the “Jeopardy” Professors Tournament, a three-round affair pitting educators from institutions across the country against one another.</p><p>Sam has been a fan of the show since he was a 7-year-old boy watching the show in his grandma’s house in the 60s. The show returned in the ’80s and has been on pretty much ever since. “We watch it constantly,” Buttrey says. “It’s very comforting. The rules don’t change. It’s very G-rated, family-friendly and I find it very entertaining.”</p><p>Sam recalled walking onto the set he has spent years imagining at home as “crazy,” since he was first enamored with Art Fleming’s black-and-white edition of the 57-year-old show and pretty much every version since.</p><p>Aside from the opportunity to compete, the “Jeopardy” invitation also included travel and lodging fees, which are not often provided to contestants. Buttrey noted that while regular players must pay their way to play, being a part of the Professor’s Tournament received special treatment.</p><h3><strong>Is Sam Buttery On IG, Facebook?</strong></h3><p>Sam Buttery is on Facebook.

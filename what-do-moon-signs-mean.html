Your Moon sign shows your needs in relationships and how you will get along living with someone else. Going into a relationship, it’s even more important to know your partners Moon sign than Sun sign.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s a guide to all the Moon signs, though first check out this <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lunarium.co.uk/moonsign/calculator.jsp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Moon Sign calculator" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Moon Sign calculator</a> to find yours. You will need your exact time of birth to determine your Moon sign as the Moon changes sign every couple days.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Aries</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You love the thrill of sudden love (or lust) and are not afraid to bear your heart on the first date. If things become too routine and predictable, you can often lose interest so it’s important to keep things fresh and exciting with your partner. You express yourself honestly, quickly and put your feelings all on the table. If others aren’t as quick to jump, it does not mean that don’t like you – others may need a slow simmer to feel more secure. Igniting the passions in those around you, make sure you are prepared to finish what you start.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Sexting, quick make-out sessions in the elevators, massaging the head, ears</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Taurus</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Your Moon is in the sign ruled by Venus giving you that sweet and sensual vibe. Unlike the sign before you; routines, stability and predictability is a big turn-on for you. In fact essential if you are even going to make it to a second date. You may enjoy cooking with your partner, hiking together, or even playing music together. You will take time to explore everything about your partner (as long as they make you feel secure). Connoisseurs in the boudoir, you have that magical touch that can hook anyone. Though soft sheets, good music, and gourmet meals win you completely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Kissing the neck and shoulders (ruled by Taurus). Following through on your word</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Gemini</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Always learning, always reading something new – you love to ingest loads of information and then can still be thirsty for more. That said, your partner must be up to speed with the gift of gab – able to chat about anything and maintain flirtatious (and newsy) text threads throughout the day. You need that wordy contact, even in the bedroom. At the end of a day, if it was a hard day or easy day – you just gotta talk it out. Nothing turns on a Gemini Moon more than telling them exactly what you want to do to them when you get home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Words, whispers in bed, talk about their ideas with them</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Cancer</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You are ruled by the Moon meaning you are queen (or king)ui of all those feels. In a relationship you like a partner that can express their true feelings as emotional security is number one. You need to know that they are all in so that you can relax. It can be hard for you to let go if you don’t trust. However, once you feel safe, you can be the most supportive and nurturing partner. Together you will enjoy creating a home together and caring for each other in it the new space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Envision a cozy future together, talk deep feelings in the bedroom while gazing in each other’s eyes</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Leo</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even though your Sun sign may be more modest, deep down you are a wild child and need a healthy dose of that spotlight. In love, you need to be seen, witnessed in all that you process, and even worshipped. There must be romance, flair and excitement for you to stay interested. It’s most important always that you can express yourself and that your partner will hold space for your radiance. Once in love, your creativity and generosity will spill into crafting playlists and gifts for your partner (as long as they remain a true admirer in love).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: strip tease, photo shoots, dancing together</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Virgo</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You care so much and want to help others succeed, so naturally you’ll go to great lengths to do all of those little things that make your partners life seem easier. And similarly you would want the same in return – practical support on the daily. For the Virgo Moon, love is a series of promises that are kept, being there for each other’s health, work and daily needs. You want to feel that your partner supports your mission in the world and you want to be able to support theirs. When this happens, you can fall madly in love like never before.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: working together on a shared goal, serving each other, showing up on time and being dependable</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Libra</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You are cosmic queen of foreplay, being ruled by Venus. In love and in the home, you need a most beautiful and peaceful environment to truly share your graces with the world. Known as a staunch supporter and advocate for those in need, you have no problem as well – rolling up those silky sleeves to make sure that nobody is getting unjust treatment. In the home, you decorate like breathing and art just happens - like beautiful table settings and wall treatments. Hot heads and slobs need not apply.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Extended foreplay, silky lingerie, the perfect lighting</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Scorpio</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Your feelings run deep – all or nothing. When you are in, you are absolutely in and will do just about anything for your partner…as long as they earn your trust and do not betray it! You need a soul level type of commitment and nothing less. Living with a Scorpio Moon means you will sometimes need to give them the space to process all of their emotions and it can take days. They do this silently so don’t expect to hear updates. Once they are ready, they will emerge from the cave and love you like never before.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Vows, make up sex, role play, bondage</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Sagittarius</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Your bohemian soul needs to feel free, even when committed. Your partner must give you the feeling that the world is full of adventures to explore together. You aim to learn new things together, travel the world hand in hand, and always inspire each other. Do not ever make a Moon in Sag feel caged in. You have big ideas for the greater good of humanity and a partner must be in alignment with your higher ideals for this to work. Activities like international travel, hiking, or going on a retreat together will be your idea of a couples outing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Travel, obscure romantic get-away, making out in planes, trains and anywhere</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Capricorn</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The security of everlasting and unconditional love is what your soul really craves. And perhaps you did not receive all the hugs early on, though it’s never too late. In your relationships, mutual admiration is essential - you want to be recognized by your partner for your achievements and support them in all of their endeavors. Feeling responsible comes naturally to you so you may enjoy the tasks that come with raising a family and managing a household. Though make time for the caring love and support that will nourish you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: Weekly household meetings so nothing is left to chance, ambition, drive, marathon sex</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Aquarius</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not many can figure you out. You may feel like you landed here from the mothership and had to enter a human suit. That said, you have always felt a bit different than others and so have a deep alignment with the underdogs. In relationships, you need your alone time and to be able to show up as the otherworldly magnificent being that you are. And acceptance for all your otherworldliness is what you deeply crave. As an independent thinker and prefer to surround yourself with other non-traditional types. Home must be a place where you can feel accepted and part of a unit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: genius, rebels, yoga and meditation with your partner, tantric breathing</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Moon in Pisces</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You are the most sensitive out of all of the Moon signs - feeling everything - and you can even sense what you partner is going through just by being in the same room. Some may call you intuitive or psychic even. Because of this super power it’s crucial that you have a peaceful home environment, preferably near water. Taking lots of breaks and baths will help to feel cleansed from the imprints of the day. In love, you can soar to the heights of romance and also require a partner who is just as sensitive and loving as you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turn ons: a seaside beach house weekend getaway, foot massages, cuddles</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fff9dbcd-eb84-4932-8461-f287e3ccb154.jpg alt="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" title="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As the exclusive astrologer for Harper’s Bazaar, Rebecca Gordon brings the highlights of cosmic news to you as it happens in the skies above.

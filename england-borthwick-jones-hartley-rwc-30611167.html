and in that area, Steve Borthwick is already winning ahead of his first <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Rugby World Cup</a> as England chief.</p><p>At least according to Dylan Hartley, who has paid his former team-mate and captain high praise ahead of England's opening warm-up fixture against Wales on Saturday. The two Home Nations kick off the 2023 <span>Summer Nations Series at Cardiff's Principality Stadium with the first of two back-to-back meetings.</span></p><p>Each team has major improvements to make after changing coaches at the end of 2022, with Premiership-winning boss Borthwick replacing his ex-mentor, Eddie Jones, at Twickenham. The former acted as understudy to Jones during his past stints with the Red Rose and Japan, serving as England forwards coach for five years before taking the head role at Leicester Tigers in 2020.</p><p>But <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>rugby</a> veteran Hartley - who played alongside Borthwick for two years before eventually inheriting the captaincy himself - believes England's new leader figure was already gaining experience in the role under Jones.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Eddie Jones brands reporter 'smarta***' and demands 'respect' after Australia humiliation</a></b></p><p>"For me, if you talk about the best coaches I've worked with, Eddie was miles ahead of everyone else," the 97-cap former hooker told <b>Daily Star Sport</b>. "Not because he was better, but because he was older. He had far more experience.</p><p>"So Steve goes in and does his apprenticeship with a guy who's been around the block, coached in every continent, won and lost World Cups. He's famed for his man-management skills - or methods [smiles] - and Steve experienced that first-hand alongside me. He was a rival of mine, he was my captain and then he became my coach.</p><p>"Eddie obviously banged the drum from the top and set the expectations, but in terms of feet on the ground, Steve Borthwick was the guy going to bed at midnight, one o'clock in the morning with session plans done in detail to the second. And he was the guy up at five o'clock the next morning training the next day.</p><p>"I don't know if that's sustainable. He may be running things differently now, but he was the guy with feet on the ground making the team tick, you know? I say he was our forwards coach, but I'll tell you he was our head coach. Eddie was 'the boss', but Steve was our head coach."</p><p><b><i>Who do you think is the greatest England rugby captain of all time?

However, it's evident the New-Zealand born ace has long held Borthwick in high regard.</p><p>In fact, Hartley repeatedly underlines the incumbent England chief's diligence and work ethic as traits that have long suggested he would make for a good coach, even during their time together as players. Former Bath and Saracens lock Borthwick was in the twilight years of his international career when Hartley earned his senior debut in 2008, but the matched skill set was obvious then.</p><p><b><i>Follow the Daily Star on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Threads</a></i></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30605428.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_Untitled-1.jpg><p>Hartley has the rare perspective of working closely with Borthwick as both team-mate and coach, as well as forging a close relationship with Jones prior to retiring in 2019. The arrival of Borthwick and his new coaching staff has been heralded as the return of a certain 'feel-good factor' among the England camp, but there may be more similarities between Jones and his former protÃ©gÃ© than many might perceive.</p><p>"We always evolve, we're always learning. The environment when I started under Eddie and [then forwards coach] Steve was difference to the one that I left," replied Hartley when asked about reports of a 'lighter' feel among England's camo since Borthwick arrived. "So they're always evolving because standards got better, expectations got better, players understood what when it was [time to] work and when it was down time.</p><p>"Steve has been around rugby a long time. He knows the guys and what they need to tick. That said, you talk about it being a jovial or relaxed environment - he is a very, very hard man. He's a very hard taskmaster. He has got unbelievably high standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>"He's very calculated in that respect. Steve will be very truthful and tell you exactly what he expects, what he wants from you. Someone who's very diligent so you respect his work ethic. He's the strong, silent type."</p><p>Borthwick will name his squad on Thursday ahead of the first of four fixtures in the Summer Nations Series. England and Wales will clash again at Twickenham on August 12 before the Red Rose take on world No. 1 Ireland and Fiji in their final two 'friendlies' before heading to France.</p><p>A disappointing 2023 Six Nations could be forgiven considering Borthwick was barely one month into the role at the time, but that defence may not hold as much water this summer. That being said, it's not like this is his first attempt as England's head coach.</p><p><i>All 15 Summer Nations Series matches are available exclusively on Prime Video in the UK.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e86tn56qXai9sL7TrGaeppehrq%2BwjJumq6yYrLakt4yjpqedo2K1or7TpZyyZaKssG5%2Fj29oamlmbA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./wrong-embryo-story-pt2-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;IVF doctors sued over embryo mix-up continued their lucrative practices despite past lawsuits</a>

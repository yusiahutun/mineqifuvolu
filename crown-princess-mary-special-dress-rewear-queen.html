Mary often appears at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, an event centered around sustainability in fashion, which explains her love of rewearing items.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOKtuFrQpvK data-wc=93>"However, she may have chosen to come back to this dress on this particular occasion as burgundy is sometimes thought to symbolise ambition and sophistication, as well as being associated with wealth and prosperity," Amy adds. "Historically, burgundy had connotations of luxury and was often used to represent royalty or higher-ranking members of society. Similarly to the <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Of Wales</a>, Mary likes to bring attention to local designers, rewear outfits and it could be said that they both also often wear the colours associated with their respective countries, such as red and white."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/70f6befd4489-gettyimages-1896863942.jpg><p id=eyrvHRqxy6H data-wc=65>Personal stylist and style lecturer <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sian Clarke</a> adds that "choosing to wear red is a very savvy move because it's a colour that catches our attention and becomes super memorable to the public eye. Her choice tells us that she is confident to take on her new role with grace and reassures the public that she will be able to complete her duties with strength.&nbsp;</p><p id=eluu11gJ35 data-wc=51>"By rewearing her stunning gown exudes her resilience, gestures to the importance of sustainability, and she understands what works for her and her style.

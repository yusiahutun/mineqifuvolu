He had 3 chances to tell his story he didn't. A polygraph is not admissible in Maryland and neither is a decision not to prosecute.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>CPS said in a statement: 'The department takes very seriously its duty to protect the health and well-being of children and ensure youth are safe. While confidentiality laws prevent us from providing specific details regarding your questions, Child Protective Services (CPS) has a duty to conduct either an investigation or a family assessment if someone reports that a child has allegedly been abused or neglected.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Before closing an investigation, we will determine the nature, extent, and cause of any child abuse or neglect and, if possible, the person responsible for the abuse or neglect, and share that investigative report with law enforcement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Maryland Department of Human Services employees care deeply about the safety and well-being of children, and we work relentlessly to ensure all families we serve are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

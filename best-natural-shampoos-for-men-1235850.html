On the other hand, if you want to exfoliate your scalp, it is best to choose active ingredients like salicylic acid, vitamin C or vitamin E. People with dry strands should go for moisturizing ingredients in their shampoo like shea butter, avocado oil, coconut oil, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b) Components to Avoid- </strong>Watch out for the harmful components like SLS or SLES, parabens, dyes, phthalates, synthetic fragrance, formaldehydes, alcohol, dyes in the first place. If your shampoos contain any of them, they are not natural.</p><p><strong>c) Formula- </strong>Make sure the formula you're choosing for yourself goes well with your hair and scalp type. If you have a dry scalp and oily shaft, it is wise to choose a product that claims to treat the flaky scalp while retaining moisture into the hair. Similarly, for people who have the opposite, it is best to go with a formula that removes excess sebum from the scalp without making the hair shaft dry.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There you go!

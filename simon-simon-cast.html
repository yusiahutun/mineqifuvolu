It’s undoubtedly why it connected with the audience so strongly throughout its 1981 to 1989 run.</p><p><a href=#>Gerald McRaney</a> and <a href=#>Jameson Parker</a> are, respectively, brothers Rick and Andrew Jackson (“A.J.”) Simon, who form a private detective agency in San Diego, California. Sounds like a pretty standard set-up, but the hook is that these brothers couldn’t be more different.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Rick had served in the Marine Corps Vietnam and enjoys wearing the regalia of a cowboy, while A.J. has a preppy look, is a college graduate (unlike his brother) and is definitely not the kind of rule breaker that Rick is. Needless to say, there’s comedy and drama to be mined from their different personalities and outlook on things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/simon-simon_rZBlGn.jpg><p>The rest of the Simon & Simon cast consists of <a href=#>Mary Carver</a> as their mother, Ceceilia Simon (the only other character that made it through every season), <a href=#>Eddie Barth</a> as Myron Fowler, A.J.’s former boss and owner of a competing detective agency; <a href=#>Jeannie Wilson</a> as Myron’s daughter, Janet Fowler; the wonderful <a href=#>Tim Reid</a> as a cop who is a friend to the brothers, Lieutenant Marcel Proust “Downtown” Brown, and <a href=#>Joan McMurtrey</a> as Lieutenant Abigail Marsh.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>‘The Six Million Dollar Man’ Cast: What Happened After the 1970s Bionics</a></p><p>The series lasted for 156 episodes.

Born on August 19, 1947 in Collins, Mississippi, he made his big screen debut in Night of Bloody Horror (1969), admittedly not so distinguished a start, but went on to appear in 18 other films, most recently 2019’s A Violent Separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/simon-simon_j6tqRK.jpg><p>Prior to leading the Simon & Simon cast, he first appeared on television in a 1972 episode of <a href=#>Rod Serling</a>‘s horror anthology <a href=#>Night Gallery</a>, and followed up with dozens of other appearances on episodic television and TV movies. Right after the series came to a close, he shifted over to play Major John D. MacGillis in <a href=#>Major Dad </a>(1989 to 1993) and then appeared in 10 additional TV movies between 1993 and 1995. He had recurring roles in <a href=#>Touched by an Angel </a>(1995 to 1998) and Central Park West (1995 to 1996).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/this-is-us_Rw9jD4.jpg><p>From 1996 until 2023 he has worked consistently in dozens of TV movies with starring or recurring roles in such shows as Promised Land (1996 to 1999), Deadwood (2005-2006), Longmire (2012 to 2015), <a href=#>House of Cards</a> (2013 to 2017), <a href=#>NCIS: Los Angeles</a> (a total of 54 episodes between 2014 and 2023), <a href=#>This is Us</a> (2016 to 2022), 24: Legacy (2017), Filthy Rich (2020) and Duncanville (2021 to 2022).</p><p>One point the actor makes is that right from the start of Simon & Simon, he had a plan for role diversity. “I like to do different parts to get away from this,” he told the Messenger-Inquirer in 1983. “Rick’s a role I could easily get typecast in. Rick’s kind of an outlaw. It’s a good character and one of the most interesting on television.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-1198072332.jpg><p>Although he never served in the armed services, McRaney plays military personnel in a number of his roles, and often expressed his support to soldiers and veterans. In his personal life he’s been married three times (including current wife, <a href=#>Designing Women</a>‘s <a href=#>Delta Burke</a>, who he wed in 1989) and he has three children.

This led to work in a number of TV miniseries and movies and, after Simon & Simon concluded its run, he continued doing so with credits that include Have You Seen My Son (1996) and Something Borrowed, Something Blue (1997). He guest-starred on Gerald McRaney’s Major Dad and Promised Land.

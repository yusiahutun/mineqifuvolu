Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess who the celebrities are based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from a studio audience is sent home and takes off their mask to reveal their identity.</p><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/the-masked-singer-cast-season-11/ rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The King of the Mask Singer</a> in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp;“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a> executive producer Craig Plestis told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”</p><p>The Masked Singer premiered in 2019 with host Nick Cannon and judges Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1687129/why-nicole-scherzinger-leave-the-masked-singer/>Nicole Scherzinger.

It’s just so crazy and it’s like a huge game show, and such a great family show. You can’t really go wrong. I mean, you may look crazy with the names you [guess], but who cares? Because the whole show is a bit bonkers anyway, so it doesn’t feel like work at all.”</p><p>Throughout The Masked Singer‘s 10-plus seasons, dozens of celebrities, including LeeAnn Rimes, Jesse McCartney, Gladys Knight, Donny Osmond, and T-Pain, have competed on the show under secret identities and complex costumes.

Vanessa Hudgens, an actress and singer best known for movies like the High School Musical franchise, is our best guess for Goldfish on The Masked Singer Season 11 based on her voice and clues. Read on for the clues that support Hudgens as Goldfish on The Masked Singer ahead.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2><strong>“Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo (Week 1)</strong></h2><p>Goldfish performed “Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo in Week 1 of The Masked Singer Season 11, which was a clue to Hudgens. Rodrigo played Nini Salazar-Roberts in Disney Plus’ High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. In Season 1 of HSMTMTS, Nini played Hudgens’ High School Musical character, Gabriella Montez, in a high school production of the Disney Channel original movie.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4644268774704><h2><strong>Posing from cameras and running away from them; paparazzi flashes; Hollywood can be a little “soul-sucking” (Week 1)</strong></h2><p>Hudgens was in a high-profile relationship with her High School Musical co-star, Zac efron, from 2005 to 2010. “A sense of knowing I’m a part of something bigger than myself has allowed me to enjoy life more,” Hudgens told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Marie Claire</a> in 2013 about the media attention she received during her relationship with Efron. “And not worry about the little things, like paparazzi.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2><strong>Glass slipper (Week 1)</strong></h2><p>A glass slipper is worn by Cinderella in Walt Disney’s 1950 movie Cinderella. Hudgens’ movie franchise, High School Musical, is also a Disney production and aired on Disney Channel. Cinderella, who is a princess, could also be a reference to Hudgens’ Netflix movie franchise, The Princess Switch.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.3621285418106><h2><strong>She could play it safe or dive into “deeper, darker, edgier waters” (Week 1)</strong></h2><p>One of Hudgens’ first movies after the end of the High School Musical franchise was 2013 thriller The Frozen Ground,&nbsp; in which she played Cindy Paulson, a 17-year-old prostitute who escapes the murder of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen and helped lead police to his capture. “I mean it’s different from anything I’ve done but that’s the way I love it. I keep on doing these different parts – but she’s a girl who has very little self love, you know she, she’s just a survivor I really admire that about her,” Hudgens told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Wonderland</a> magazine at the time about how the movie was different than the work on the Disney Channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Following High School Musical, Hudgens also starred in 2012’s Spring Breakers, in which she played a college student who goes to spring break in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she falls into the world of drugs, crime and violence, and 2013’s Gimme Shelter, in which she played a runaway teenage girl who becomes pregnant. “I think that’s what auditioning is for. I take pride in my auditions because people in general know me as Gabriella Montez, so not only do they not know what I can do, but they have a preconceived idea of who I am. So I auditioned for Gimme Shelter and Spring Breakers and won them fair and square. I think I showed my chops doing that,” Hudgens told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in 2013.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.4791418355185><h2><strong>“Sometimes the most transformative moments are actually breakups. I always thought I would be married young, like my mom, but dating in Hollywood is hard, and this Goldfish wasn’t always lucky."</strong> <strong>(Week 6)</strong></h2><p>Hudgens has been in two public relationships. She dated Zac Efron for five years from 2005 to 2010, and she dated Austin Butler for nine years from 2011 to 2020. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.shape.com/celebrities/interviews/vanessa-hudgens-interview>Shape</a> in 2021, Hudgens revealed that her mother was 25 years old when she got married, a timeline she also thought she would follow. “Where I am now is better than I could have dreamed of,” Vanessa said. “My relationship with myself is something I value deeply, even if things don’t always go the way I expected. For instance, my mom got married at 25, so I always thought I was going to be married at 25. That didn’t happen,” she said.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.48179271708683><h2><strong>She saw her ex everywhere and their run-ins were turned into TikToks. (Week 6)</strong></h2><p>Hudgens has run into her ex-boyfriends Zac Efron and Austin Butler at numerous events since their breakups. The most infamous run-in was at the 2023 Vanity Fair Oscars Party, where <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1361548/austin-butler-vanessa-hudgens-oscars-2023/>TikTok videos</a> showed Butler waving to fans as Hudgens walked past him while texting on her phone.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2><strong>Christmas snowglobe. (Week 6)</strong></h2><p>Hudgens starred in three Christmas movies for Netflix: 2018’s The Princess Switch; 2020’s The Princess Switch: Switched Again; and 2021’s The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2><strong>A vampire bat hanging from a tree.

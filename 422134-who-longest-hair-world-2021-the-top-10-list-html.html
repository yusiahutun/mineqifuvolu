Hair is a symbol of beauty and most especially for ladies. In some cultures, long hair is associated with fortune, love and longevity. Most ladies would prefer to grow their hair long. However, others get irritated as soon as it grows past their shoulders.</p><h2>List of people with the longest hair in the world</h2><p class=align-left>On average, human hair grows 6 inches per year, meaning that it would take five long years to grow your dream waist-long hair.

The length of her <a href=#>dreadlocks</a> is 19 feet 6 inches or 5.9 metres.</p><p class=align-left>Maintaining the hair isn’t easy for Mandela.

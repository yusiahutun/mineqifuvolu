It is associated with the old English name 'Holly' and its Latin name is Ilex aquifolium. The flower symbolises luck and good fortune; many believe it brings good luck to anyone born under its sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1d49c2316d705971.jpg><p class=align-left>Holly is a deep green shrub with bright red berries and has long been associated with <a href=#>Christmas</a> and the winter solstice.

In <a href=#>other words</a>, December is a holiday season in most cultures. While December is a time of joy and celebration, it is also a time of reflection and contemplation.</p><p class=align-left>Holly is associated with the winter solstice, which marks the beginning of winter.

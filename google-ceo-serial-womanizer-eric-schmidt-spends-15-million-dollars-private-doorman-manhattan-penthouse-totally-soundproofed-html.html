She revealed he had given her a prototype iPhone (late Apple boss Steve Jobs was a friend of Schmidt’s), whisked her away for romantic getaways and lavished her with expensive jewelery.</span></p><p><span>She wrote of her pain at their breakup, saying: ‘I’ve been sleeping with my Blackberry just in case Dr Strangelove might send an email.’</span></p><p><span>At the time of the affair, Schmidt was at the height of his power. He was brought in as Google’s CEO in 2001 by creators Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who relied on his expertise to turn their modest internet search engine into a global media powerhouse.</span></p><p><span>But Google has been criticized for not doing more to protect users, particularly children, against the&nbsp; proliferation of porn on the web.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/25/article-2377785-1AFDF700000005DC-903_634x306.jpg height=306 width=634 alt="Schmidt's glamorous new pad: Michael Douglas starred in 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' which was partly filmed in the Google CEO's new penthouse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Schmidt's glamorous new pad: Michael Douglas starred in 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' which was partly filmed in the Google CEO's new penthouse</p><p><span>Google, which says it has a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy on child sexual abuse content, has argued policing the billions of images, stories and data generated daily on the internet would be a Herculean task and any controls could inadvertently restrict legitimate online searches. It says parents can use Google ‘filters’ like SafeSearch to prevent children accessing pornography.</span></p><p><span>‘What I worry about is that such laws are often slippery slopes,’ Eric Schmidt told a conference in May 2012. ‘In many other countries, adult pornography legislation is an attempt to legislate something else.’</span></p><p><span>But a source who knows Schmidt well defended him, saying: ‘Eric is integral to the success of Google and in enabling it to become a hugely successful company that employs 35,000 people around the world and is a service that is much-loved by its users. He was a great CEO and very well regarded as someone with extraordinary technical knowledge and great business acumen.’</span></p><p><span>Bohner did not return calls or emails this week, possibly bound by her believed confidentiality agreement, but her close friend Parsley insisted: ‘It was a serious romance, at least as far as she was concerned.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘To my knowledge he would pay for her to travel to see him. He was always promising her he would get divorced. She cried on my shoulder countless times. She believed wholeheartedly he was going to leave his wife for her.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/20/article-2371719-1AE8E4D9000005DC-551_634x650.jpg height=650 width=634 alt="Google CEO Eric Schmidt with his then mistress Kate Bohner at Burning Man in the Nevada Desert in 2007.

Schmidt posed with his arm around his mistress, although he refused to join the masses camping in the desert, preferring a five-hour round trip to the nearest hotel.</span></p><p><span>Parsley continued: ‘They communicated a lot by phone and email when they were not together. But it devastated Kate that he would chose to spend holidays with his family. It was always the same, Thanksgiving, Christmas, all the big ones.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I am speaking out because Kate has been the victim of unfair comments online. In any affair, the woman always gets the blame – “Oh, she knew he was married.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘Well, in this case it’s not so cut and dried. Yes, Eric was and is married. But he needs to look at himself long and hard and start living a truthful life. Eric wants to have his cake and eat it too. He has had numerous affairs and everybody knows it.’</span></p><p><span>Like Bohner, Schmidt’s other reported girlfriends have been glamorous, successful women of a certain age.</span></p><p><span>There was Marcy Simon, a leggy blonde PR executive in her mid-40s who was spotted with him on holiday on the French Riviera in 2006 and, according to reports, remains close to him still. He gave her a large, canary-yellow diamond ring.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/25/article-2377785-1AFDF7C9000005DC-370_634x261.jpg height=261 width=634 alt="With money no object, Billionaire Schmidt has invested in getting the 6,250-square-foot duplex soundproofed to ensure complete privacy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>With money no object, Billionaire Schmidt has invested in getting the 6,250-square-foot duplex soundproofed to ensure complete privacy</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/20/article-2371719-1AE8E5AF000005DC-355_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Kate Bohner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/25/article-2377785-1AE4A4F2000005DC-658_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Marcy Simon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>TV presenter Kate Bohner, left, and PR woman Marcy Simon, right, were both lovers of Eric Schmidt<br></p><p><span>Website Gawker.com reported on their split in December 2007, and also alleged that the couple rekindled their relationship in 2009,&nbsp; when they were reportedly spotted together at the Aspen Ideas Conference in Colorado and in California.</span></p><p><span>Schmidt was also linked to Lisa Shields a 47-year-old divorced single mother who worked as a producer for America’s top-rated breakfast show Good Morning America.<br></span></p><p><span>According to the New York Post, in 2011 Schmidt took her on holidays aboard his $72.3million superyacht Oasis to the Caribbean and the South of France.<br></span></p><p><span>They were spotted dining out in the millionaire’s playground of Southampton in upstate New York, and according to the New York Post were ‘also spending time at a summer rental in the Hamptons’.</span></p><p><span>A source told the Post at the time: ‘She has been telling friends they are dating and they have been going out openly in New York and the Hamptons as a couple.’</span></p><p><span>Shields now works as a publicist for the Council On Foreign Relations in New York, and speaking from her weekend home in the Hamptons did not deny her reported relationship with Eric Schmidt, but added: ‘I never comment on my personal life.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/20/article-2371719-1AC5EC8D000005DC-309_634x523.jpg height=523 width=634 alt="Eric Schmidt has been criticised because of his 'free and easy' approach to others' privacy while using his vast wealth to protect his own" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Eric Schmidt has been criticised because of his 'free and easy' approach to others' privacy while using his vast wealth to protect his own</p><p><span>Schmidt’s most recent affair, according to the New York Post (which has taken particular delight in his extramarital interests) was with sultry Vietnamese concert pianist Chau-Giang Nguyen, with whom he has been spotted dining at upscale New York restaurants.</span></p><p><span>A source said: ‘He has been very supportive of her music career.

In our case, we are both busy. I think it’s nonsense and, between us, if we know what is going on in our lives and we are happy, that kind of stuff is part of his being in the public eye.’</span></p><p><span>She added she would tire of ‘following’ her husband around the globe: ‘I would feel like a piece of luggage, and he wouldn’t want me&nbsp; to feel that way.’</span></p><p><span>When asked about his open marriage Mr Schmidt told The New York Times : ‘I don’t think that is an appropriate question.

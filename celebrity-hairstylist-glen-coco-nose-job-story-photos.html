In July 2021, he revealed that he got a rhinoplasty. In a BAZAAR.com exclusive, he opens up for the first time to writer Jessica Ourisman about his decision to get the surgery. <strong>Warning: </strong>This story includes some graphic post-surgery images.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">I never considered rhinoplasty until seeing myself on camera. I began my acting journey in 2019, and when seeing myself in my first show, [the web series] Handsome, I started to scrutinize my nose. My family has a history of large nostrils that grow over time, and I've seen them all get bigger nostrils with age. So the first time I saw myself onscreen, I noticed my nostrils first and, later, that there were parts of the tip that I didn't like. I decided I wanted to make a change and in 2020 started researching to find a surgeon I felt comfortable with.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because a few of my clients and friends have had rhinoplasties, they were able to offer me advice. Everyone told me that you have to find the surgeon who's right for you—with good bedside manner, an aesthetic that agrees with your taste, and who can provide you with a realistic outcome. While researching, I looked for really good before-and-after photos that were not doctored. I also wanted someone who could cater to different faces and face shapes, and their unique looks. I didn't have reservations; I just knew I wanted to do thorough research.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Everyone told me that you have to find the surgeon who’s right for you.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During this process, I knew I wanted to go through with it because of TikTok. It seemed like everyone was posting their rhinoplasties on the platform. I remember that there was this specific sound bite that everyone was posting with them. I became obsessed and went on a rhinoplasty deep dive. I even saw one of my clients, Dixie D'Amelio, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR9Q5wbu0GU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="post about her rhinoplasty journey" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">post about her rhinoplasty journey</a> with Dr. Raj Kanodia—before she was my client!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Raj was actually the first surgeon I considered. I looked at his before-and-after gallery, and I love how his work looks on his patients and my clients, but I felt that it was a little too feminine for my face. I communicated with four different doctors via phone, and then had one in-person consultation. Mostly, I wanted to talk about ballpark pricing before having my in-person consult. I knew right off the bat I wasn't going to spend $25,000 on a rhinoplasty, so I wanted to get that conversation out of the way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The surgeon I chose is named Ari Hyman. I had so many questions for him. For the most part, I wanted to know how realistic my expectations were and to be assured that my nose would still look masculine if I went through with surgery. I also previously had filler in my nose to get rid of a bump, so I wanted to know if I needed to dissolve that. At our consultation, we took photos from four or five different angles, and then we assessed them for 30 to 45 minutes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We ultimately met three times prior to the actual surgery date. He really encouraged me to come back in so that we could work through any worries I had and to ensure this surgery was exactly what I wanted. There is usually a long wait time for surgery, but due to a cancellation, he was able to schedule my surgery date during a two-week break in my work schedule. It was the perfect timing, so I put down my deposit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, I got nervous. I was like, "Okay—this is happening. There's a date in the calendar." But the morning of surgery, I knew there was no going back.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I arranged for friends to drop me off and pick me up. On the day of, it was such a quick process: You fill out paperwork, put in your final payment, and then you're taken to prep for surgery. They take your vitals, make sure you're good to go for surgery, and inject you with anesthetic—and I swear, it flew by. I remember talking to the doctor, going down to the room, seeing three ceiling lights, and then knocking out and it was over.</p><img alt="glen coco nose job" title="glen coco nose job" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nose-job-lead-1652282325.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ari Hyman MD</span><p>Glen before his rhinoplasty, above, and after, below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During my recovery, there was honestly zero pain. Everyone said that on TikTok, but I didn't believe it. Surprisingly, day one was a blast: I recorded TikToks and was calling and FaceTiming everybody. My doctor sent photos of me on the surgery table, and that day I was so loopy that I sent them to people whether they were close to me or not.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then came day two, which was very uncomfortable. I woke up not being able to breathe. This is due to swelling, but also gauze packed up my nose. Because of this, I was doing a lot of mouth breathing, and my lips and even tongue got extremely dry. There's also a process of having to clean your sutures, apply ointment, and change your gauze every couple hours.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I jumped back into work after just three days. I remember the first day back I had appointments with Paris Hilton and Megan Fox in the same day, with my cast on. Paris hates blood and was teasing me, like, "Oh, my god, I can't look at you!" Megan was just amazed I had gone through with it and was so curious and asking questions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout recovery, I didn't take a single painkiller, because I really wasn't in pain. They wouldn't fix how I couldn't breathe through my nose, which was the uncomfortable part. To help, I was doing hyperbaric oxygen therapy at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://remedyplace.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Remedy Place" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Remedy Place</a> in West Hollywood for an hour every day, which I started three days before surgery. I did this to pump my body with oxygen prior to surgery to speed up the healing process and reduce swelling. I don't have anything to compare it to, so I don't truly know if it helped me heal. Still, it made me feel better to know I was doing what I could to try and expedite the recovery process.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My cast removal happened sooner than most people's. I did mine after six days, but usually, it's after seven. (To be honest, my doctor was going out of town, and I didn't want to wait.) At first, I was zero percent happy with my results. I was being filmed, and you could see the fright in my eyes—I had a full-on panic attack in the room. As Dr. Ari was showing me how to apply this tape, called micropore tape, to reduce swelling, I was looking at myself in the mirror thinking, I completely do not recognize myself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I would say it took about four or five months to get used to my face again, and it was a challenging time. (It turns out this was because I had an open rhinoplasty, which results in more swelling, but I didn't know that yet.) When that happened, I was just like, "No one talks about this process—about how it feels like a completely different face from the face you grew up with." It's so scary to see yourself as a different person.<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I said, ‘No one on TikTok goes through this!’<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I ended up going back to Dr. Ari to talk through my fears, because I was so in my head about it. He had to keep reassuring me that my nose was going to get smaller and that everybody goes through this. I said, "No one on TikTok goes through this!" That was when he explained to me that this was because the people on TikTok were getting something called a closed (or endonasal) rhinoplasty, as opposed to what I had gotten, which is called an open (or external) rhinoplasty. Open rhinoplasties take longer for the swelling to go down but, according to my doctor, have lower revision rates, which means you are less likely to have to go back under for another surgery to correct your results.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That being said, I actually did request a revision. A month and a half after, I got a base reduction, which he performed under local anesthesia and at no additional cost. Immediately after that, I was happy. It was still extremely swollen, but I knew that was what my nose needed to be slightly better, and he agreed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are things I wish I had known about open rhinoplasties beforehand—like how it swells on a plane, or when landing in a humid region, or even if you eat salty foods. There are so many things that affect it that people I know who have had closed rhinoplasties don't experience. So that's something I have had to get used to, but only while it continues to heal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There have also been so many moments when it was swollen that I hated what it looked like. I became obsessed with micropore tape—at night, on airplanes—to reduce the swelling. Now, it's been eight months, and it's the most consistent it's ever been, even when I travel. I can see it shrinking day by day, so I'm happier and happier. Most people experience what their nose is going to look like by a full calendar year; for some people, it's a year and a half. I'm just going to let it be until a year and a half goes by and know that will be the final result.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It took me a long time to be happy with my nose, but now I'm so happy. I have never really been shy about taking photos, but now I'm more eager to take them. When I first got the surgery, my doctor would see photos and tell me, "Your nose looks so good!" But at first, it would be because I edited them! Now I'm at a place where I don't edit my nose at all, and I feel more confident and better looking on camera (and off).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppraW2FcXyYbmacnZyar7O107JkoZmZp8C1xcuiqq1ll6Gyr3nCqJqoZZ6kwKZ5yaiZZqukpL%2B6ec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./halle-bailey-showcases-toned-legs-in-latex-boots-in-revealing-new-snap.html>&#171;&nbsp;Halle Bailey showcases toned legs in latex boots in revealing new snap</a>

His relationship with ex-wife, Nicole Murphy, marked his only legal marriage and yielded five of the actor’s ten children.</p><p>Despite seemingly sharing twelve years of bliss, Eddie and Nicole’s marriage ended on a sad note. The resulting drama has remained part of the friendly exes’ lives to date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201027-100159_1603791491040.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=EDDIE_MURPHY_AND_NICOLE_MURPHYS_RELATIONSHIP></span><strong>EDDIE MURPHY AND NICOLE MURPHY’S RELATIONSHIP</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nicole and Eddie had their first encounter in 1988, at the NAACP Image Awards show. They kicked off their <a href=#>romance</a> shortly after and sustained a long-term relationship for almost two years. During their time dating, the pair welcomed their first daughter, Bria Murphy, born 1989.</p><p>On March 18, 1993, Eddie Murphy tied the knot with the supermodel at New York City’s Plaza Hotel. The duo went on to have four other children, including Myles Murphy, Shayne Murphy, Zola Murphy, and Bella Murphy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=THEIR_DIVORCE></span><strong>THEIR DIVORCE</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Twelve years into their union, Nicole Murphy filed for a <a href=#>divorce</a> from the “Dr. Dolittle” star, citing irreconcilable differences. They finalized the divorce in April 2006.</p><p>Despite their sad split, the one-time couple remained on friendly terms, becoming an epitome of the ideal co-parenting relationship.

Their short-lived affair yielded a daughter, Angel Iris Murphy, born in April 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>He also began a <a href=#>relationship</a> with movie producer Tracey Edmonds.

Butcher became Eddie Murphy’s fiancé in September 2018, and the lovebirds have sustained their relationship to date.</p><p>Nicole also lived out an interesting romantic life. She kicked off a relationship with football star Michael Strahan in 2007 and enjoyed a blossoming romance for two years. Strahan popped the big question in 2009, sealing their romance with an engagement ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201027-101736_1603791602479.jpg><p>Sadly, like Eddie, Nicole had little luck with her post-divorce relationship.

The world received the news with disdain, with most sharing their disappointment at Nicole for having an affair with a married man.</p><p>Fuqua, who had been married to actress Lela Rochon-Fuqua for 20 years, was immediately tagged as an adulterer. Nicole, on her part, released a statement days later, claiming she and the director were family friends and simply shared a friendly kiss in the pictures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Fans revolted over her petty excuse, prompting the star to release another statement apologizing to the public. She also rendered an apology to Lela and her family for her alleged affair with Fuqua.</p><p>Following the whole kissing frenzy, sources confirmed that Eddie Murphy was disappointed in his ex-wife. Reportedly the duo had a heated exchange, with the comedian pointing out that the affair was an <a href=#>embarrassment</a> to the family.
